**DRAGON'S EGG** was a neutron star, an incredibly dense sphere only twenty kilometers in diameter, with a surface gravity sixty-seven _billion_ times that of Earth. No 
human could ever land on such a star. Only by the most advanced technology could science even study it.

Yet on that impossible world, researchers detect intelligent life: the cheela, aliens who live so fast that one of our hours is the equivalent of more than a hundred 
years to them. The cheela struggle from savagery to science in a span of daysâ€”and the astronauts orbiting above Dragon's Egg are by turn observers, then teachers, then friends...

Then a monstrous **STARQUAKE** rocks Dragon's Egg, decimating the cheela. On the surface, the few survivors fight to stay alive. Meanwhile, high above the neutron star, their human friends face a dreadful choice: return to Earth and let this alien race risk extinction, or remain to help...and certainly die in the attempt!
