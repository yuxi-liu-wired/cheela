Abdul Nkomi Farouk's nimble brain woke up softly, ready for anything. He slowly opened his eyes and grinned inwardly at the sight of his brown arms floating aimlessly in front of him. He was awake, but they were still asleep.

"Get busy arms!" he thought to them. "You have a lot of button pushing to do today if we are ever going to get that neutron star mapped."

However, the first thing that the arms did was their now automatic twist and curl of the tips of Abdul's fierce black moustache. Abdul's eyes watched the arms in amusement. He then gave them his first direct command. Instantly his body dropped from its dreamlike trance and became one with his mind. He unsealed the sleeping cocoon and pushed off to the head.
