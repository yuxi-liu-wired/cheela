"Let's try again," Swift-Killer said. Keeping the dark detector in front of one of her eyes, she went back to the apparatus. This time she held the valve herself with a set of manipulators, while a set of tendrils felt off the knots in the tally string.

Much later Swift-Killer called a halt. The second message had been beamed up to the Inner Eye, and still there was no response.

"If only we could be sure that our weak light could be seen at that distance," Swift-Killer complained bitterly.

"You could climb to the top of that peak over there," North-Wind said with mild sarcasm. "Cliff-Watcher and I will be glad to beam a message up to you and you could check on the reception."

For once, Swift-Killer was silent. She could think of nothing else to do but to try again.

They were nearing the end of the third message when a loud crash came vibrating through the crust. Swift-Killer didn't move. The highly developed sonic direction-finding apparatus in her tread had told her exactly what had happened.

"The glancer has fallen," she said. Her eyes, which had been concentrating on the work of monitoring the fall of the drops of pod juice onto the end of the flare, continued their gaze while Swift-Killer slowly turned the valve off, closing it tightly to prevent leaks. She pouched the vial, and then finally turned her attention to the base of the nearby cliff where the glittering shards of the broken glancer lay in a shattered heap.

Swift-Killer flowed over to the base of the cliff, forming a manipulator as she went. She felt through the sparkling pieces, but found none that were anywhere near the size of the original mirror.

"At least we got some of the messages off," Cliff-Watcher said consolingly.

"Yes, but there are still more, and we ought to repeat them as often as we can to make sure they are received," Swift-Killer said. "We must find a way to keep sending without using the glancer."

"Perhaps we can find a suitable chunk of crust around here," North-Wind suggested.

"I'm afraid not," Swift-Killer said. "I have been looking at the various types of crust as we passed by different formations, and all the material in these mountains seems to consist of fuzzy crust. I have not seen anything around here that had anywhere near as shiny a cleavage surface as a glancer. We will have to think of something else."

Swift-Killer tried many things. However, there was no way that she could get a beam formed and directed upwards to the Inner Eye. She had even tried leaning the expander up against the cliff at an angle (being careful this time to back it up with chunks of crust), but the light from the flare came in at such an angle that the light reflected from the expander was sprayed out in a distorted beam that rapidly dissipated into the sky. She knew where the focus spot of the expander was, but it was an unreachable point way up in the sky, at least a dozen times higher than she could reach, and almost as high as the cliff itself. Then she had an idea.

"If we put the expander flat on the crust, pointing up at the Eyes," she said, "then the focus spot will be up around the top of this cliff. If we climbed up there with the flares we could make the light near the focus and the beam from the expander would go straight up to the Eyes."

Being a trooper, North-Wind said nothing, but Cliff-Watcher exploded. "You can't be serious. That cliff must be twice as high as you are wide. It will take you a dozen turns to climb that high, even if you can find a route, and we are out of food! We will be nothing but bags of skin if we ever make it!"

"You are not going," Swift-Killer said. "You will stay here. I will need to have you move the expander to different positions along the face of the cliff until we get the focus spot so it is just above the edge of the cliff where we can reach it."

Swift-Killer went to the broken glancer, picked up one of the larger shards and pouched it.

"Let's go, North-Wind," she said, and took off toward the far end of the cliff, with the obedient trooper close on the tread of his Commander.
