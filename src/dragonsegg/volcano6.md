Pierre turned from the display on his console and called over to Jean, who was operating the Lyman-alpha telescope at another console. "I was trying to think if the weather would be any different on Earth if the magnetic field of the Earth were east-west instead of nearly north-south."

"No," Jean said. "The Earth's magnetic field is too weak to affect the atmosphere on Earth as it does here."

Pierre laughed, and Jean looked at him quizzically. "I just realized that the only real effect of an east-west magnetic field on Earth would be on homing pigeons. Homing pigeons use a combination of the earth's north-south magnetic field and the east-west Coriolis spin forces for homing. They would feel completely lost if the magnetic field lines and the Coriolis force lines were in the same direction---as they are along the spin equator here. That would be even worse than the fact that the directional sense of a homing pigeon gets turned around when the pigeon is released in the southern hemisphere after being trained in the northern hemisphere."

Pierre turned back and spoke at the console:

"Store that sequence!

"Continue monitoring volcanic lava flow pattern on Priority Two basis!"

He turned to Jean, "Well, the main console is all yours. I'm going to get some food, write a little, then head for bed. See you next shift."

Jean pulled herself into the main console seat, quickly checked all the settings, and carefully buckled herself in. "What are you writing now?"

Pierre stopped himself at the hole in the deck and replied, "It's a physics text for the ten-to-fourteen age bracket. According to the communication flashes from the publisher, I made such a hit writing scan-books about science and space for the eight-to-twelve age group on the way out to Dragon's Egg that I actually have fan clubs. Do you realize that when I get back from this trip two years from now I am going to be getting more in royalties from children's books than I will in salary for being a space scientist?"

"Well, none of us are jealous---much!" Jean said. "We all realize that every kid you make enthusiastic about space science is going to be a voting taxpayer after we return, and we should come back to Dragon's Egg with a follow-up expedition before it leaves the Solar System."

"I'm sure the World Space Administration agrees with you. They even gave my publisher a special rate on the cost of transmitting my manuscripts back." He turned and pushed himself down the passageway.
