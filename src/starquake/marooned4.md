Pierre's hands and feet had been pulled through the water and slammed against the walls of the tank by some unimaginable force as the viewscreens had turned dark. For three long seconds alarms had rung throughout Dragon Slayer as the computer tried to repair its damage and return to operation. The multiple screens built into the walls of his tank finally lit up again.

"Report status," he said.

"Starquake on Dragon's Egg," the computer responded. "Systems suffered damage from gamma rays and gravitational waves. Status 82% operational."

"We have received a significant dose of radiation," said Cesar from his portion of the multiple screen. "Those of us in the tanks have received 120 rems. Half-fatal dose is 500 rems."

"Amalita!" Abdul shouted. "Amalita! Answer me!"

There was no answer.

"Something is wrong," said Abdul. He started to purge his tank.

"I am the doctor," said Cesar. "_I_ will check on her."

"The surface of Egg has suffered severe damage," Seiko said. "All activity has ceased. I have activated the scanners."

"All communications with Egg are gone," said Jean. "We do have contact with the East Pole Space Station." Her face on the multiple screen was replaced by that of a flickering cheela, checking in every tenth of a second.

"Any life below you in Bright's Heaven?" Staring-Sensor asked.

"No," said Seiko. "Saw thermal flare at East Pole."

"We know," said Staring-Sensor.

"High energy vehicle from West Pole to East Pole," said Seiko.

"We know."

One of Seiko's screens showed a flashing circle overlaid by the computer on a scanner display of Bright's Heaven. "Patch of new vegeta..."

_"Where!?!"_ Staring-Sensor interrupted.

"Inner Eye Inst..."

Seiko stopped talking. The cheela had gone.

"Doc!" said Pierre. "Have you found Amalita yet?"

"Yes," said Cesar. "She's dead"

"I don't think we'd better take a ride with Otis until we get things straightened out here." Pierre commanded the computer to cancel the planned change in trajectory for the deorbiter mass. It would be nearly a day before the asteroid worked its way around to where they could call it again.
