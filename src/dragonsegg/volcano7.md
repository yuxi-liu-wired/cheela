Great-Crack was a pack rat. Although one of the better hunters in the clan, with two Flow Slow kills to her credit, she was the constant butt of jokes from her hunting mates because of her habit of picking up and carrying anything she found that looked interesting---and because of her highly developed sense of curiosity, practically everything looked interesting to her.

When it came time for the hunting party to load up with ripe pods for the long journey back to the clan, Great-Crack had to unpouch her trinkets so she could load up her pouches with pods. She went over to a shallow depression in the crust; amid ribald calls of "What are you doing? Laying three eggs at once?", followed by "No, just one, but it's the size of a Flow Slow!", she dumped her precious pile of odds and ends, with the heavier ones around the pile in a low wall that she hoped would protect them from the constant winds. With luck, she would be able to pick them up again when they returned with the clan.

With her bulk reduced to fighting trim, Great-Crack flowed off the pile. Paying no attention to the jokes, she went off with the others as they moved through the petal plants, carefully picking off the best of the pods and storing them inside their body pouches until the whole hunting party was loaded to capacity.

"Are you sure that bulk is all pods, Great-Crack?" chided Shaking-Crust. "You didn't go back for a few trinkets, did you?"

Great-Crack was in the midst of rippling out a vicious whisper about being a better fighter when loaded with pods than Shaking-Crust was in fighting trim, and would she like to have her prove it... when Blue-Flow interrupted with a loud t'trum on the crust.

"You two stop that!" he said. Then his eyes looked around to all of them and he called, "It's time to go back!" Blue-Flow pushed his bulk in the hard direction, while the rest of them rapidly formed a single file and pushed off behind him.

Suddenly Blue-Flow stopped. "Wait!" he said in amazement. "We're going in the wrong direction!"

They all looked up from their crouched, streamlined positions in back of him and looked ahead. There was the benevolent beam of Bright, directly ahead. They stopped, confused. They had come into Bright's Heaven far enough that they had stopped having the lost feeling that they had experienced earlier under the smoke. Being good hunters, they knew instinctively where they were and in which direction to go. But their instincts were leading them directly toward Bright, while they knew from logic that the way back to the clan was in the opposite direction.

"I guess we will have to forget our where-sense when it comes to traveling in this land," Blue-Flow said. He flowed to the back of the column and pushed off again, this time directly away from Bright.

The group soon reached the edge of Bright's Heaven. They all cast longing looks behind with a few of their eyes as Bright dipped below the horizon and their sense of being lost returned. Blue-Flow kept the break periods short since they were all in good shape and well fed, and they made it quickly back across the "feeling lost" territory with its intense smoky sky flowing to the west.

Their sense of direction slowly returned, and Blue-Flow felt much better now that his instincts finally agreed with his logic. They were following their previous track very closely, and Blue-Flow was disturbed that he could read their spoor. They must have been extremely discouraged to have been so careless. Well---they were on their way back now, and that spoor of many turns ago would just lead any trackers astray if they kept their present track clean. When it came his turn at the rear of the column, he looked back and was pleased with the fact, that except for a quickly fading whitish track from the heat of their bodies warming the crust, he could see almost no evidence of their passage.

At the next break, most of them had another pod to eat. As was her usual custom, Great-Crack kept all the seeds from the pod in case the clan needed more. Blue-Flow noticed that she had only added a pod skin to the burial pit and came over to talk to her.

"You are a good hunter and a hard fighter, Great-Crack, so I have never complained about your bulk. But we are now on a very serious mission and everything that slows us down hurts the chances for the survival of the whole clan. I want you to put all the seeds and anything else you have picked up into the burial pit and stop collecting things until we have the whole clan back to Bright's Heaven."

"But the seeds are valuable!" she protested.

"The clan will have no need for seeds to plant when they are on the move to Bright's Heaven, and there will be plenty of pods and seeds when we bring them there," he replied.

She could only agree with him, and he stood by watching, first with amusement, then with amazement, as a steady flow of seeds, pebbles, worthless dragon crystal shards, and Flow Slow nodes filled the burial pit. He did not know that Great-Crack held back something. In each one of the food pods from Bright's Heaven, the bottom seed in the clump had an unusual twelve-pointed cluster shape, instead of the normal oval shape. Great-Crack's curiosity had been aroused by the unusual shape and she had looked carefully at each pod she had opened. Every pod had a cluster-shaped seed, and she was especially careful to keep each one. She wanted to plant them to see if the petal plant that grew from them would be different in shape than the ones that grew from the oval seeds. When she dumped her store of treasures, she withheld the cluster seeds.

"They are so small, they won't slow me down," she said smugly to herself. "Besides he will never notice, now that I have an egg growing." Covering up the burial pit carefully to leave no trace of its presence, she returned to join the others.

After many, many turns the hunting party began to enter familiar territory. They took no breaks now, but pushed steadily onward. As they approached the home of the clan, they felt disturbing tremors under their treads. There were loud voices booming through the crust and much rapid movement of treads. Some of the voices were in a strange accent.

The clan was under attack! Blue-Flow moved ahead more rapidly. Thinning way down, he stopped just over the horizon from the camp. He quickly reinforced an eye-stub and raised one eye up to evaluate the situation.

A large war party from another clan was attacking the petal plant field. He could see movement between the rows as the war party drove the guards down the rows, so that others could strip the pods from the plants at the ends of the rows. There was another group that kept up feinting attacks on the pod bins and stockades on the other side of the camp, spreading the clan guard warriors thin. There seemed to be too few guards, and Blue-Flow could not see Smoky-Sky anywhere. There were no enemy warriors on their side of the field, so the plan of attack was obvious. Blue-Flow dropped his eye and whispered the situation to his group.

"The petal plant fields are under attack by a large war party that has control over the eastern half. We will go east from here, staying below the horizon, cross over in the hard direction until we are in back of them, then come down at them from the east and trap them in between." As he spoke, pods and digging tools dropped out of pouches into a disorganized pile on the crust. Rugged fighting manipulators sprang from their bodies and pulled sharp shards of dragon crystal from their weapons pouches. Although Great-Crack tried to hide them, Blue-Flow saw with disgust the small pile of funny pod seeds. He resolved to give her a drubbing once the battle was over.

With their killing spears of shattered dragon crystal at the ready, the hunting party moved east, going many times faster than their previous rate of movement in the hard direction. Once they had moved far enough east to be over the horizon in that direction, Blue-Flow led them across in the hard direction until they were in back of the attacking party.

Putting his warriors in a line, each with one or more sharp spikes sticking out from strong manipulators firmly imbedded in their thickened front ends, he whispered to them all. "They do not know we are attacking, so move as quietly as you can. If we can surprise them, we will catch them with their brain-knots in our direction."

They moved ahead smoothly, keeping a low profile as they came over the horizon. They flowed around a pile of pods that had been stacked for pickup.

Blue-Flow whispered, "We're in luck. The pickers have gone down to fight and push the guards further back."

They each chose a row and with their quarry busily engaged in a battle midway down the row, they were able to attack almost without warning.

It was hard to kill a cheela. If hit with something hard, the fluid body just retreated from the blow with the flexible skin absorbing the impact. If the something hard was very sharp, like the shattered end of a dragon crystal, it could poke a hole through the skin, and if that was big enough a hole, some of the glowing fluid inside would leak out before the automatic protection systems could close the wound. If an eye that was so rash as to be out on a stub could be caught, a sharp-edged shard might slice off the eye-stub with an accompanying shock of pain but only a partial loss of sight. After all, if one or two of the normal complement of twelve eyes were lost, the cheela could easily adjust the position of the remainder to have nearly complete vision.

The only really vulnerable part of a cheela was the brain-knot. It could be anywhere inside the skin, but it was a good bet that, if the cheela was fighting someone on one side, the brain-knot would be well over on the other side, far away from any sharp spears of dragon crystal. Blue-Flow was counting on this instinctive behavior as he rushed his enemy target from behind and flowed up onto her topside. He felt the telltale knot under his tread and shocked it into unconsciousness with a focused ripple from his underside, then neatly speared it three times as his momentum carried him up and over his now-dead foe.

"Blue-Flow!" shouted Weary-Tread, lowering the point of her spear. "Where did you come from?"

Blue-Flow surveyed the oozing hide of his old friend and replied, "We just got back and we have found a new home for the clan. But come, follow me, we have fighting to do."

Blue-Flow moved down the row of plants until he could see a sparring trio of warriors between the plants. Warm-Wind and Great-Crack had an enemy warrior between them. The warrior had parried Great-Crack's initial rush and was now fending them both off as he attempted to escape between the rows. In a rumble of despair he saw the long shard in Blue-Flow's grasp as Blue-Flow blocked the way, sending his spear directly into the center of the enemy.

"Another brain kill!" Blue-Flow gloated as the foe collapsed into a spreading disk that filled the space between the plants.

He quickly whispered to Great-Crack and Warm-Wind, pointing with a ripple of his eye-stubs, "You two go that way and we will go this way." Blue-Flow turned and, with Weary-Tread covering his trail, went down the row to find more of the foe.

With the return of the hunting party, the tide of battle turned, and soon the enemy war party had retreated, without their stolen pods, and with many of their number gone.

The clean-up work began. The stolen pods were stored in the pod bin along with the ripe pods that the hunting party had brought back with them. The many dead, among them Fuzzy-Crust and Star-Rise of the clan, were sliced open to let the fluid seep into the crust, and then the meat was dried and stored.

The news that the clan had for the hunting party was not good. They had been under almost constant attack by hungry war parties ever since the group had left. Smoky-Sky had died long ago in a battle to protect the fields and Weary-Tread was now Leader of the Clan. When Blue-Flow heard this news, he turned and looked at Weary-Tread, whose scarred hide was still oozing glowing, yellow-white fluid from some serious spear wounds.

"Now is the best time to do this," Blue-Flow thought. "The clan needs a strong Leader for the journey to Bright's Heaven." He turned, raised his spear and issued the formal challenge to Weary-Tread.

"Who is Leader of the Clan, Old One?"

There was a long pause as Weary-Tread evaluated her chances. She could still be a good Leader and did not want to be relegated to the status of an Old One, but never had she felt so like the dreary name she had been stuck with as a hatchling.

"You are, Blue-Flow," she replied, and winced as the ceremonial slash from Blue-Flow's spear added another small wound to her punctured hide.

Blue-Flow turned and said to them all, "I am Leader of the Clan. Does anyone challenge me?" There was no reply, and, with the formal ceremony over, his tone changed as he took command.

"I have good news. I have found a new land for us. A clean land with no smoke. A good land with no enemies, with much game and with many, many petal plants that have never been picked. It is a long distance away in the hard direction and the trail will be harsh and difficult. But we will go, for a new God Star and His Heaven---Bright's Heaven---waits for us!"

For the next few turns, Blue-Flow had everyone who was not out hunting meat busy in the fields picking the edible pods and storing them in the pod bin. He was outside the bin with Great-Crack, looking with satisfaction at the pods spilling out of the opening.

"It is enough," he said. "We will leave when the hunters return."

"But _is_ it enough?" Great-Crack wondered. "We needed to eat many, many pods to get from Bright's Heaven back to the clan. There are many in the clan and they will travel much more slowly than a hunting party."

"There are many, many pods, Great-Crack. There must be enough there to feed all the clan, for I have never seen so many pods before." Blue-Flow went off to greet a returning hunting party.

Great-Crack stared at the flowing pile of pods. "There are many pods," she thought. "But are there enough?"

She played internally with her pouch full of cluster-shaped seeds, which she had retrieved after the battle, and thought back over the many pods she herself had eaten while crossing the barren land between here and Bright's Heaven. Many pods would be needed, for she had taken the cluster-shaped seed from each one as she had eaten it, and there were many, many of those seeds in her storage pouch.

Then, in a flash of inspiration, one of the greatest mathematical minds ever hatched in the past or future history of the cheela made a great leap of abstract thought.

"I took one seed from every pod that I ate," Great-Crack said to herself. "So I have as many seeds as pods."

Her mind faltered for a moment. "But seeds are not pods!"

It recovered, "But there are as many seeds as there were pods, so the number is the same."

She laid the seeds out in a row that stretched all along the wall of the pod bin. There were many of them. She then took out pods and put one next to each seed until she had a row of pods.

"There," she said. "I will need that many pods to get to Bright's Heaven." She put the pods to one side in a pile. She took out more pods and laid them next to the seeds until she had another row of pods.

"Blue-Flow will need these pods to travel to Bright's Heaven," she said as she gathered the pods up again and put them in another pile.

Great-Crack soon had pile after pile of pods stacked inside and outside the pod bin as she set aside rations for each of the clan members. She was only halfway through the names of the clan members when she ran out of pods. There was not enough food!

Great-Crack hurried off and brought Blue-Flow back to the pod bin to explain what she had done. She got nowhere.

"Yes, I see the piles of pods, but how do you know that each person will need that many?

"Yes, I see that when you line up the pods next to the seeds that the line of pods is as long as the line of seeds, but what do seeds have to do with pods?

"Yes, I understand that you saved one seed from each pod as you ate it on the way back from Bright's Heaven, but what does that have to do with feeding the clan? You ate all those pods and there is nothing left but these deformed seeds.

"No, I don't understand what you mean when you say that the seeds tell you how many pods each one of us will need. Seeds are not pods."

Great-Crack tried in many ways to get Blue-Flow to make the jump in abstract thought that now came so naturally to her, but he could not do it. Finally, in frustration, he lost his temper and stamped, "There are plenty of pods. Look at them all. We will go now, for Bright's Heaven is waiting."

Great-Crack flowed to block his way. "We cannot go!" she said, "We will starve before we get there! The seeds tell the truth!"

"Seeds are not pods," he retorted, "and I have been meaning to tromp you for keeping those seeds after I told you to leave them on the trail."

Her reply brought him up short. "Who is Leader of the Clan, Old One?"

She moved toward him while he backed out of the pod bin. "No use endangering the pods," he thought. "We are both in good shape and this is going to be a long fight. I wonder why she is challenging me now?"

The clan gathered around them as they moved together into a clear place between the stockades. Blue-Flow watched with a combination of fear and amusement as his opponent emptied her pouches of tools and trinkets, formed a dueling manipulator, and raised her spear.

"Blue-Flow is in good shape," Great-Crack thought as she made a neat pile of her precious "unusual things." "I will need every advantage I can get to beat him. However, he must not be allowed to win---for he will lead the clan into sure starvation!"

She finally turned, raised her spear and repeated her challenge, "Who is Leader of the Clan, Old One?" She paused---then punctuated the challenge by ejecting her half-formed egg sac from the protection of her body onto the crust between them. The clan looked in shock at the precious, tiny eggling wriggling out the last of its life among the glowing remains of its ruptured egg-sac.

Blue-Flow alternated his horrified eyes between the cooling eggling and the stern visage of Great-Crack. "She is really determined to win. Could it be that she is right, and there are not enough pods?" He shifted his spear. "No matter---things have gone too far to stop now."

Blue-Flow returned the formal reply, "I am---Hatchling!" He lunged at her.

It was not a pretty fight. Both were encumbered by the rule that they had to maintain control of their spears to keep from automatically losing, but were not allowed to use the points for cutting until the final ceremonial slash of the loser by the winner. They wallowed, struck at each other's eye-stubs with the sides of their spears, trod one another's edges, tried to wrest the spear from the other's grasp, and slapped each other with muscular pseudopods in an attempt to deliver a knockout shock to the brain-knot.

The usually fluidless battle for Leadership ended in a shocking way when Great-Crack found Blue-Flow's spear pointing in an opportune direction and deliberately impaled herself on it, taking it into her body. No longer in control of his spear, Blue-Flow had lost. He shook the glowing gout of Great-Crack's fluid off his dueling manipulator onto the crust as she repeated her challenge. "Who is Leader of the Clan, Old One?"

"You are, Great-Crack," Blue-Flow replied.

Great-Crack maneuvered her body and Blue-Flow watched, horrified, as his sharp spear broke out of the rapidly healing wound in Great-Crack's side. The spear reached over to his surface and gave him the ceremonial cut, the fluids from the two bodies mixing together as they dripped off the spear point onto the crust.

Although she had suffered a significant wound, the injury would only slow an excellent fighter like Great-Crack, and when she repeated the challenge, no one had the courage to reply.

Great-Crack then told the gathered clan, "We will go to Bright's Heaven, but not now. We do not have enough food to survive the trek across the bad lands between here and Bright's Heaven. We must grow more pods. Go back to the fields and plant many more seeds. We will go after the next harvest."

The clan turned to their work, their disappointment at the delay in reaching Bright's Heaven countered by their natural reluctance to leave their home. Within a few turns, Great-Crack had mended, and she spent the time making sure not only that the clan planted enough seeds, but that she wouldn't lose the services of Blue-Flow, one of the best warriors of the clan. At every opportunity she patted and teased him. In a few turns, he got over his sulk at losing, gave in to the teasing, and they enjoyed a romp together. Soon she felt a new egg growing inside her to replace the one she had sacrificed.

Great-Crack planted a few of the funny cluster seeds in one spot and watched the plants with interest, but to her great disappointment the plants, pods, and seeds inside were just like the plants grown from the oval seeds from Bright's Heaven. She could never figure out why.

While the crops grew, Great-Crack played with mathematics. In the same manner as she had learned to identify pods with seeds, she now had a collection of pebbles, one for each member of the clan.

With the new crop coming in, a new pod bin had to be constructed. Great-Crack decided that it was about time to check to see if there were enough pods for the clan. She did not look forward to hauling all those pods out of the bins, lining them up against the collection of seeds that she had accumulated on her trek back from Bright's Heaven, then putting them in stacks, and back into the bins again.

Then she made another conceptual breakthrough.

"Why do I have to move pods around?" she thought. "I can make a collection of seeds, one for each pod in the bin. Once that is done, then it is much easier to move seeds than pods."

Soon the pod bin had a smaller bin outside the opening containing a pile of seeds, one for each pod in the bin. Monitoring the bin was the cheek's first accountant, an Old One assigned to the task of adding a seed to the seed bin for each pod put into the pod bin, and taking one seed out for every pod eaten.

As the harvest proceeded, even the number of seeds grew to overflow their bin. Great-Crack looked at the seed bin and was both pleased and appalled at the number. Now that she had learned to use her mathematics to make her job easy, she kept trying to think of other ways to make it even easier. She mused as she pushed the seeds around in stacks. She then noticed that since the seeds were long ovals, they had a tendency to form into clumps. She found that if she arranged them so that their sides just touched, they formed a pretty cluster. Although there were too many to count, there was always the same number if they were all pushed together so that all the sides just touched. It was a pretty pattern, just like the cluster pattern of the bottom seed of the pods from Bright's Heaven. She put one of the cluster seeds next to the collection of seeds. They looked identical. Then the now familiar habit of isomorphic identification struck again.

"If a cluster seed looks like this small clump of seeds," she wondered, "why don't I just save a stack of cluster seeds, each one representing a whole clump of oval seeds?"

Soon she had the seed bin replaced with a smaller one containing a large number of cluster seeds and a few odd oval seeds left over. That bothered her a little, having some pods represented by cluster seeds and some by oval seeds, but it helped that the cluster seeds were a little bigger than the oval ones. Her real problem came with her accountant, who didn't understand at all.

"The old way was very simple, Great-Crack," the Old One said. "One seed in the seed bin for one pod in the pod bin. But this does not make sense. How can one seed, even a cluster seed, mean many pods?"

Great-Crack tried hard to explain, and ran into the phenomenon that is often encountered by one trying to teach someone something---the teacher often learns something new herself. Great-Crack learned to count past three.

"Now look, Old One, I will go through it carefully. Here is one pod, and one oval seed. Here is another pod next to the first pod, and another oval seed next to the first seed. That's two---and now three." Great-Crack moved the third pod and seed into place, then reached for another set.

"Now this many is..." Great-Crack fumbled for the nonexistent word. "...the same number of ways that you can travel: east, west, and the two hard directions." She continued adding sets. "And this many is the same as the number of fangs on a Swift. And this many is the number of petals in a petal plant..."

She went on. "And this..." she said as she completed the pattern, "is the number of bumps on the cluster seed. It is as many as your eyes."

The accountant dipped each of his dozen eyes, one after the other, as he carefully touched each of the seeds in turn with a delicate tendril. "So it is," he said, "That will make it easy to count them."

The lesson really didn't sink in the first time, but after many repetitions even the accountant was using one, two, three, travel, swift, petal... all the way up to a dozen, as if he had learned it as a hatchling. But soon even that did not suffice, for there were so many pods from the harvest that Great-Crack had to invent the name "great" for a dozen dozen of pods. The accountant was very satisfied with her choice of word, for it obviously represented a "great" number of objects.

With the accountant's help, Great-Crack checked the results of the harvest. First the pebbles, one for each member of the clan, were placed in a column, then across the bottom were placed cluster seeds, only now the unique collection of cluster seeds that Great-Crack had accumulated during her trip back (and which measured the distance to Bright's Heaven in terms of pods) had been replaced by a concept---a number---a petal worth of cluster seeds plus a swift of oval ones.

The forecast was not good. As the cluster seeds grew out from each pebble, Great-Crack came to the end of the seeds before she came to the last of the pebbles. Great-Crack felt once again the frustration of being Leader of the Clan. The volcano had become more active and the sky grew steadily worse. With their vision of the sky clouded, the crops grew poorly and the harvests were meager. Their neighbors to the east and west were hungry and restless and there had been many more attacks on the fields of the clan. They must go. But there were not enough pods.

Great-Crack stared at the diagram in front of her. Although the pebbles and seeds were far removed from hungry bodies and nourishing pods, they still foretold of great anguish for all.

"I can strip the unripe pods from the plants before we leave, and they will get ripe enough to eat after a few turns," she thought. "There are usually about two nearly ripe pods per plant." She flowed over to her stockade, where she kept a pile of seeds that represented the number of plants in the fields. She soon returned with a collection of seeds that represented the unripe pods in the fields, but even when these were added to the diagram, there were not enough.

"Dragon's Fire!" she swore to herself. She shrank from making the obvious decision, arguing with herself, "But there are so many pods, surely there are enough for all to go." But the diagram, empty at the top and end, stared at her with its cold logic.

"A dozen plus two of the Aged Ones will have to stay," she decided, and winced as the numbers changed to names in her mind.

She called the clan together. To solidify her control as well as to signify her seriousness, she started with a formal challenge.

"Who is Leader of the Clan?" she asked, and her tread felt and marked the chorus of replies.

"You are, Great-Crack!"

Her eyes singled out and stared at a few warriors who were slow in responding, but soon all had replied. She then said, "We leave for Bright's Heaven at the next turn, but there are not enough pods to feed us all on the long journey, so some can not go." She reeled off the names of the Aged Ones who were either too injured or too old to be of much value anymore, and they stoically accepted their fate, having grown weary of life after so many turns. It did not take long for the clan to strip the unripe pods from the plants and load up the eggs, hatchlings, pods, and their few tools and weapons into skin pouches tucked inside their bodies. The clan left their home, moving as always according to the rule of the ancient Old Aged Ones: "Go in a direction others do not go."

The massive group of burdened cheela pushed slowly south. It was almost two turns before they could no longer see the stockades and fields that had once been their home. Shortly after they had gone over the horizon, one of the guards at the rear broke ranks, pushed his way ahead and came up to Great-Crack, who was part of the pathbreaker chevron at the front.

"One of the Aged Ones that we had left behind is following us," the guard whispered to her.

Great-Crack left her place in the chevron, doing it carefully so that her replacement just in back of her could close the gap smoothly, thus preventing any loss in the progress she had made. She and the guard flowed quickly east and waited as the clan moved slowly by.

Great-Crack looked at the approaching Aged One. "It is West-Light, one of the most able of those who were left. Why is he coming?" They waited for almost a turn until the exhausted West-Light approached them.

"You heard my command, Aged One!" she stamped at him. "You cannot come with us. There is not enough food! Go back now or I will kill you instantly!"

West-Light stopped and emptied out his pouches. He had been carrying some half-ripe pods from the fields that must have become edible since the trek had started, along with some nearly ripe wild pods.

"We were worried that perhaps there might not be enough food to keep the hatchlings healthy," West-Light said. "So we gathered what we could these past few turns before you got too far away for me to reach. Here---take good care of the hatchlings."

Great-Crack whispered, "Thank you, West-Light." She moved forward to pick up his meager offering. She then stared as the thinnest cheela she had ever seen slowly pushed his way back to their now abandoned camp.

"He has not eaten a thing since we left," she thought to herself. She turned and went back to join the rest of the clan, still moving slowly southward towards Bright's Heaven.

The trek was dreary. The progress was much slower than Great-Crack had counted on, and she felt the pouch of seeds that represented the remaining food get smaller and smaller after every break. The quality of the food became worse as they ate all the ripe pods and started on the ones that had only partially ripened in their pouches. The littlest hatchlings didn't want to eat these and were constantly sick. Great-Crack sent out hunting parties both east and west, but often they came back with neither pods nor meat. Great-Crack grew desperate. They were losing a hatchling every few turns; for the first time in ages, some of the clan's eggs refused to hatch and had to be left after it became evident that the eggling inside was dead.

"All the clan is in poor shape," Great-Crack said to herself as she worked in the rear, constantly closing gaps that a youngster or an Old One had let fall into the body of the traveling group. She looked backward. There was a long, straggling column that had become separated from the rest of the group when one of the members faltered and allowed the hard direction to close in on him. She watched as he attempted to move forward again, but it was obvious that the speed he was able to make in the hard direction would not be fast enough to let him and his followers catch up with the rest of the clan. She then saw a movement off in the smoky east that sent her into action.

"Attack from east!" she stamped as she pushed her way through the crowded clan members. When she got to the eastern edge she saw it was serious. It was a large, hungry war party and they had already cut off the straggling string from the rest of the clan. She soon had a group of warriors on either side of her and noticed with satisfaction that the clan had stopped moving and were now in a coherent group, with the stronger ones facing outward, spears and shards bristling. She started forward to rescue the captives, when her trained senses detected something from the west. It was another war party waiting for them to attack the first group, when they could rush on them from the rear.

"Stop!" she commanded. She led the war party back to protect the rest of the clan, then watched in agony as the captives were killed and the precious pods wrenched from their flowing bodies and devoured by the hungry band of marauders. The war party stayed for a few turns, trying to figure out a way to attack the rest of the clan. They made a few abortive attacks, one of which gave Great-Crack deep satisfaction as she dispatched two of the enemy, partially to avenge the clan members she had lost. Finally the war party gave up the siege and went off toward the west, hauling the meat from their victims with them. Great-Crack immediately took the clan off again toward Bright's Heaven.

With their enforced rest, the clan was in better shape, and with the example of what happened to stragglers still etched in their minds, there were very few times that the gap opened by the pathbreakers was allowed to fail, and the clan made good time for a few turns. But it soon became obvious to Great-Crack that they were in serious trouble. At the next break she got out the pebbles that represented the members of the clan, and after discarding the ones that had been killed in the interchange with the attackers, she laid them out in a column.

She knew that they were still far from Bright's Heaven, for they had just started to get to the "lost feeling" region. She made an estimate of how many turns it would take them to reach Bright's Heaven and laid those cluster seeds out in a row. She then started to fill in the diagram with seeds representing the pods left. There was no question about it---they were short by many, many pods.

She stared at the large empty space in the diagram, and her imaginative brain turned the empty space into empty cheela. It was now time---she would have to risk the chance of another attack and split her forces.

The clan grew restless as the break grew longer while Great-Crack calculated. She finally called her warriors together and explained the situation to them. Blue-Flow had never really learned why the seeds and pebbles told things to Creat-Crack that he could not see, but he now was very glad that Great-Crack had prevented him from leading the clan off many turns ago. With far fewer pods, he would have had them all dead by now. But he didn't need pebbles and seeds to tell him that there were not enough pods for them to make it to Bright's Heaven.

"Blue-Flow," she said, "I want you to lead a hunting party to Bright's Heaven and bring back pods for us." She looked down at the diagram and said, "You will only need a Slink's worth of pods to keep you going. You are going to arrive very hungry---but the ripe pods at the end of the journey will make it worthwhile."

Blue-Flow and the others in the hunting party emptied out most of their pouches. Some of them attempted to leave without taking any pods, preferring to leave them for the hatchlings while making do with bravado, but Great-Crack, trusting in her calculations, made them take their ration of pods. The hunting party took off and was rapidly out of sight of the slowly moving clan.

With her warrior forces depleted, Great-Crack took no chances and moved the clan along carefully so that no gaps developed and the perimeter always had warriors on the lookout both east and west.

The hunting party quickly traveled over the "lost feeling" region and soon saw the welcome sight of Bright peeking over the horizon. As they came into the region where the skies became clear and the petal plants flourished, they ate their fill and then started loading up their pouches in preparation for the long trek back to the hungry clan.

Suddenly Bad-Turn whispered, "I see a Flow Slow moving just over the horizon." Blue-Flow and the others soon confirmed the sighting and they thinned their bodies to keep out of its sight.

"It is to the east and we could get to it easily," Blue-Flow whispered. "The hatchlings have been without meat since we left home. Let's kill it!"

The Flow Slow depended on its armored plates for protection. This one had never seen a cheela before, and ignored them as it ignored all small, scurrying creatures. The Flow Slow moved ponderously from plant to plant, its armored tread plates moving over its top surface to fall directly on the plant, crushing it to pulp, to be ingested in the gaps between the plates as the huge body slowly flowed onward. The Flow Slow sought out plants, but, as many an unfortunate cheela had found out, it would eat anything that happened to fall before its onslaught.

The kill was easy, since the Flow Slow had never tasted a dragon crystal spear before. The cheela slipped in ahead of it, timing their moves carefully, and planted spears in the crust in just the correct position so that the sharp points entered the gaps between the plates as they came down to the surface.

As they started to move away from the carcass, Bad-Turn looked back at it and said, "Too bad we can't carry that whole carcass back to the clan. If they had all that meat to eat, there would be no worry about food for the rest of the trip."

Blue-Flow replied, "I thought about that too. We could try to push a large chunk of meat ahead of us, but we can carry in our pouches more than we can push---especially when we have to go in the hard direction. Besides, pushing the meat through the ashes over that whole distance will ruin it."

"If we only had some way to keep it out of the ashes," murmured Bad-Turn, and he went over to one of the large Flow Slow plates and looked at it. It was large, half as big as he was. It was a flat square plate of material almost as hard as dragon crystal. At the front and back edges were curved lips that had been attached to the skin of the Flow Slow. Bad-Turn flowed onto the plate, thinking, "This could hold a lot of meat and pods, much more than I could carry in my pouches." He flowed to the front lip and stayed there for a moment, his back edge hanging back on the front lip of the plate.

"What are you doing?" Blue-Flow asked. "We should be going."

"Watch!" said Bad-Turn, and Blue-Flow and the others saw his back edge stiffen as he grew a long internal manipulator crystal that ran from one end of the Flow Slow plate to the other. Since the crystal was horizontal and did not have to fight the pull of Egg, he could make it very thin, thin enough just to fit under the lip of the plate.

"I never heard of growing a manipulator bone that way," one of the party said to Blue-Flow. Then they both watched as Bad-Turn moved away, the front of his body digging into the crust and the back edge dragging the plate along behind, firmly attached by the strong crystal bar just under the skin and stretching from one eye to another.

"It feels funny, but it works," Bad-Turn said. "Once I get it moving, it is easy to keep it moving despite its weight. With someone behind pushing, I think we could pull much more than we could carry."

The others tried it and they were all quick converts, especially when they tried it with a huge pile of bulky chunks of meat that could never be crammed into pouches. Within less than a turn, the Flow Slow had been converted into meat piled on top of its own armored plates.

The hunting party then moved off in single file, a pathbreaker leading the way, pushing into the hard direction, followed by a plate-puller crouched up behind him, hauling a plate of meat and helped along by a pusher and followed by three other teams. The meat on the plates seemed to work as well as their bodies at keeping the gap open in the hard direction, so they made good time. Their rest breaks were few and short and only for downing another chunk of nourishing meat.

When Great-Crack observed them coming over the horizon, she saw them at a great distance. Many turns ago she had stopped the trek to conserve food, while she kept watch with an eye perched up on a long eye-stub. There were no longer any pods for anyone except the hatchlings, and they were doing poorly on those. The whole clan was gathered in a circle, too weak to move much, and Great-Crack herself was forced to lower her eye-stub often.

"Fine Leader you turned out to be," she berated herself. "Leading your clan off to die beneath smoky skies in a place where they always feel lost."

Still, she had faith that Blue-Flow would return shortly with pods and that then they could move again while Blue-Flow returned for more. She was relieved when she saw the returning column, but was amazed by the bulk and length of it. Only the obvious shape of Blue-Flow breaking path at the front of the column relieved her worry that it was another attacking war party.

The clan watched in awe as the procession pulled their wonderful-looking cargo into camp. Within two turns everyone was back to a good comfortable bulk. The hatchlings were soon feeling good enough to make pests of themselves while the adults were more interested in pairing off and having a little fun alone. Great-Crack listened in admiration as Blue-Flow recounted their journey, the kill of the Flow Slow, and the results of Bad-Turn's invention.

"Bad-Turn," Great-Crack said, "for too long you have been stuck with that dreary hatchling name. From now on you shall be Plate-Puller.

"Come with me," she commanded, and some of her eyes turned to look back at Blue-Flow as they left. "I will see you later. This new name calls for a reward." Blue-Flow watched the couple go off, a little jealous, but he would have his chance later this turn.

With their strength renewed by the meat and ripe pods, the clan moved off at good speed. It was not long before they began to feel less lost. The sky cleared and finally Great-Crack called a halt and arranged the clan so that all, even the smallest hatchling, could see the intense reddish yellow glow of Bright on the horizon.

"O Great Bright One. Brightest of all in the sky," Great-Crack intoned, all of her dozen eyes staring at the bright star while her undertread rhythmically pulsed the crust. "We thank You for saving us from the rolling walls of blue-white fire. We thank You for saving us from the choking clouds of poisonous red smoke that kill the plants and still the eggs. We thank You for leading us out of the land of starvation and lostness to Your Heaven."

Her eyes turned from the star and looked around at the clan. "Let us go now to claim our reward---a Heaven where there are no enemies and plenty of food and game. Come---all of you---into Bright's Heaven."
