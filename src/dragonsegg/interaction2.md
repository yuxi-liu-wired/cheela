Suck-the-Crystal pressed the pores of his tread to the page---absorbing again the revelation that had come dripping across from the neutron-depleted plates. His thrums of joy and surprise pounded the page. From the page they were transmitted to the floor and thence to the entire courtyard of the Sky-Talk Library---raising admonishing taps from the librarians and scholars. The taps were soon followed by slower waves emanating from the methodical approach of his friend, mentor and (unfortunately at this time) Chief Librarian---Seek-the-Sky, who arrived saying, "Have you lost your senses or is it only that you've drained your nuclei dry trying to read those depleted plates of crystal and have gone into convulsions?"

"I am sorry, Seek-the-Sky. It is just that I absorbed a piece of knowledge that made my previous studies come together into one coherent piece. Here---try it."

Seek-the-Sky flowed onto the dusty, well-tasted crystal plate as Suck-the-Crystal flowed off. From the heading on the plate the librarian noted that it was an early plate from the human encyclopedia, HoloMem 2---AME to AUS. It was a table in the section on Astronomy.

"So?" Seek-the-Sky said. "This plate has been tasted so often that there is hardly a neutron left on it, much less any information that has not been correlated and cross-correlated and cross-cross-correlated by the Old Ones many turns ago. What do you find here that I don't? This seems to be a brittle, tasteless table of stellar nebula."

As he flowed off the plate he stamped, "What is so important about this that you should disturb the scholarly researches of the entire library staff?"

"But, please," Suck-the-Crystal said quickly, "it was an entry in the table that suddenly cross-correlated with some new plates that I helped prepare and catalog just this turn. A few milliseconds ago, over at the Comm Input, I had prepared the crystal plates from the turn's batch of data transmitted by the humans, and had proof-tasted them carefully with the vibrations from the acoustic delay line as any apprentice should. Now-most of the apprentices don't really care what is on the plates, just as long as they agree with the delay line vibrations---but I like to taste them and do preliminary correlations and pretend that I am the Keeper of the Comm."

"You?" Seek-the-Sky shuffled. "Keeper of the Comm?"

"Well..." said Suck-the-Crystal. "Yes!" He hastened to explain himself. "Heaven's-Bounty has been Keeper of the Comm for more than fifteen human minutes. There may be other apprentices who are older than I, but I'm the only one who really cares about the information we are collecting. I bet when the Council meets to replace Heaven's-Bounty, they will choose me. Am I right?---You're on the Council."

"Hmm," Seek-the-Sky said. "Maybe you are right-but don't let it make you spread. Now---what is this correlation that has your edges flapping?"

"The large veil-like nebula that is fifth on the list can be extrapolated back to a point of origin at a certain time about 500,000 human years ago. That point is very close to here, about 50 light-years away. That point in space and time is also almost exactly on the path that Egg is on, if you extrapolate back along its track."

"Very interesting," the Chief-Librarian said. "You have probably identified the time and place of the supernova explosion that formed Egg."

"But what is more interesting," continued Suck-the-Crystal, "is that the climatological records that are coming down right now indicate a very drastic change of climate on the human's Earth at about that time. Also, that time corresponds with the human anthropologist's estimate for the genesis of the homo sapiens species. I believe that the laying of Egg by a supernova explosion so very near the Solar System was the direct cause of the emergence of intelligence in the creatures that now float above us, teaching us all they know."

"I am sure the humans will be amused when they hear that," Seek-the-Sky said. "Let us go see Heaven's-Bounty and have her put that in her next message."
