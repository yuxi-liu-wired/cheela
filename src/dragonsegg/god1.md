God came to the cheela slowly. For many, many, many generations, the cheela had no God. The sky was empty except for a few tiny pinpricks of light scattered across the cold, black dome. Then God had become lonely and made the great volcano grow, driving the cheela from their home in the north to a new home in the south. There the god Bright had welcomed his chosen people into the Heaven he had prepared for them.

Bright had been good to the cheela. Bright never rose or set like the other spots of light, but stayed up in the sky, keeping watch over all the cheela. Life was good, and the cheela let Bright know that they were happy by their prayers that they faithfully gave every turn of Bright's throne.

Then one turn, when the eyes of the cheela were lifted to the skies in prayer, one of the supplicants saw a new speck rise over the horizon. As soon as the prayers were finished, he brought it to the attention of the Holy Ones that interpreted Bright's wishes.

The Holy Ones were puzzled, but did not let it show. As masters of their profession, they had learned to say little and do even less until they were sure of themselves.

"Yes---we expected something like that, but let us wait and we will study it further," they reassured the excited discoverer.

They did study it. It was still a speck in the sky, not much different from all the other specks, but it soon became brighter than any of the others. Fortunately, it was not nearly as brilliant as the god Bright, as it would have been difficult to explain two gods to a people that had been brought up to believe in the omnipotence and uniqueness of the One God---Bright.

The new speck grew and grew in brilliance with each passing turn, and although the common cheela noticed the increase in brightness, it was only the Holy Ones who noticed that the speck was also slowly moving with respect to the other stars in the sky. A moving star! This was unheard of in cheela astrology, where the pattern of lights, dominated by the glaring red-yellow presence of Bright, had always remained fixed in relative position while rotating slowly about Bright's throne in the sky.

"If the stars are not fixed, but move around, how can one make any kind of predictions from them? The future would be constantly changing," complained Bright's-Second, the Chief Astrologer and next in line for the position of High Priest.

"I am sure Bright has a reason for this change in the sky," Bright's-First said. "It is up to us to use our intelligence in the service of Bright and interpret its meaning."

The High Priest turned her eyes toward the young novice.

"Are you sure of the motion?" she asked.

"Yes, O Bright's-First," said Sky-Seeker. "In my training in astrology I have been learning how to estimate the angles between the star specks with the astrologer sticks and have memorized almost all my number tables. I had tried to add the new star to my memory but, still being a novice, I had failed to get all the numbers correctly. I realized my mistake many turns later when I was trying to cast a fortune. I then went back to the astrologer sticks to get the numbers correctly and I found that some of the old numbers that I had memorized did not agree with the new ones for that star."

"Unfortunately, he is correct," the Chief Astrologer said. "At first I thought his memory was faulty or that someone had disturbed the astrologer sticks. However, when I checked the numbers against the ones that I had committed to memory on the fateful turn when that star blossomed in the sky, I found out that my old numbers were even further off than the novice's, yet none of the other stars in the sky have changed their numbers at all."

"A moving star..." the High Priest murmured. "One that moves. It must be that Bright has sent us a messenger! Perhaps Bright will speak directly to us now."

Soon the religion of the cheela was broadened to include the new phenomenon, a star that not only grew brighter and brighter until it rivaled Bright in its brilliance, but which swept majestically across the skies. There was some consternation when Bright's Messenger reached perihelion and its brilliance started to fade, but all the cheela were relieved when after a few greats of turns, it retraced its path in the sky.

The new star set the small cadre of novices talking among themselves. Having been picked primarily because of their interest in numbers and their eidetic memory, so necessary for the position of an astrologer in a civilization without writing, they soon began to puzzle over the strange behavior of the motion of Bright's Messenger.

"If it were a circle, then it would make more sense," said one of the novices. "We could say that Bright and the other stars are perched on a large crystal egg that rotates once a turn, and Bright's Messenger would then be on a smaller crystal egg, turning at a slightly faster rate."

"But not only is it not a circle," another said, "it does not even move evenly along its path."

"Another way of looking at it is that Bright and the stars do not move in the sky," said a third, "but that Egg turns once on its axis every turn, and that Bright's Messenger rotates about Egg in an elongated path."

The others looked at her as if she had spoken heresy (which she had come close to doing), and one quickly put her down with one of the first lessons in Holy School.

"All stars rotate about the unique brilliance of Bright, worshiping the God of the Universe as all cheela do," one of them said. "Your picture would have the stars standing still, when we all know that only Bright, the center of the universe, stands still, while all else must revolve."

Knowing she was treading on unstable crust, Sky-Seeker did not bother to reply, although she knew as well as the others, that Bright did not really stand still but moved in a tiny circle about an invisible point in the sky. This lack of perfection of Bright had been a nagging splinter in the tread of the philosophers of theology since it was first discovered by the use of the astrologer sticks. The High Priest had assured them that they would understand this in time, but it had been a long time and a dozen High Priests had come and gone and Bright still carried out the tiny motion, without bothering to explain.
