Jean was busy setting up an alternate communication link with the infrared scanner when she heard a loud snorting bark. It sounded like an angry seal. She quickly turned, looking for the source of the noise.

"I fell asleep and snored," said an abashed Pierre, who had been handing her tools while she was head downwards inside the infrared scanner bay.

"No wonder," she replied, pulling herself out of the bay and taking the tool kit from him. "You missed your sleep shift when this ruckus started. You head off to your rack and get some sleep. You are no good to us in this condition."

"But if I go to sleep for eight hours, there will be a thousand years of cheela development before I wake up. That is like sleeping through the rise and fall of the Roman Empire!"

"Set your alarm for six hours," she replied, pushing him down the passageway, "That will give you enough sleep to keep you going and maybe you will be awake again before they develop spaceflight."
