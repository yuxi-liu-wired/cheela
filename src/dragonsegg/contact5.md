Abdul came flying over to Seiko's console. He halted his headlong dive with a practiced swing around one of the support stanchions and hung motionless just over Seiko's head.

"What reply?" he said.

"There is someone down there who is sending back pictures with the same format that you used," Seiko replied, "but they are coming from the east pole, they use thermal ultraviolet radiation instead of laser light, and they are coming very fast. Look---here is the first picture."

"It is a picture of Dragon Slayer and the six Tidal Compensators above Dragon's Egg," Abdul said. "But the star seems to be badly distorted into the shape of a pancake. It must be their star, however, because they have drawn in the mound formation. But what is that long narrow wedge with its base near us and its point over the formation?"

"It is a pointer," Seiko said. "If you look at the second and third pictures, you will see that they are almost identical, except that the position of our ship slowly shifts toward the west, while the wedge symbol gets shorter."

Seiko's fingers flew over the keyboard, and soon the first picture was joined by a second and a portion of a third.

"You are right," Abdul said. "It looks as if they want us to move to a position over their formation. I know why, too. The visibility through the atmosphere is poor in that direction. It would be much better if we were directly overhead."

Abdul suddenly realized something else that Seiko had said. "How fast was the message being sent?" he asked.

"The computer had to slow it down," Seiko said. "I estimate a pulse every four microseconds."

Abdul went back to his console and soon had a trace of the pulses from the first picture lined up on the screen. He leaned forward and looked more closely at the interval between the pulses.

"They are very irregular in spacing and amplitude," he said. "Almost as if they were handmade. You would think that a being that could make an ultraviolet laser could make a decent modulator."

"The radiation is from a thermal source," Seiko retorted.

Abdul paused as her reply sank in. "They are signaling to us with the neutron star equivalent of American Indian smoke signals!" he said. "And each one of those crude pulses is made in four microseconds---Great Allah! That means that those beings must live something like a million times faster than we do! And I have been sending the laser pulses at a rate of about once per second. To them that is like a million seconds between pulses."

Seiko quickly did the calculation for him. "As if it were about a week between pulses."

Abdul had another horrible thought. "How long has it been since they started to reply?" he asked.

Seiko's hands flicked on the keyboard, and the first picture reappeared with the time of reception in the upper corner. "The first picture arrived almost a minute ago," she replied, "and if the ratio is a million to one, that is like two years ago."

"They have probably gotten tired of waiting for an answer and have gone home," Abdul said. "We had better get busy---and fast!" He hesitated a second, then lifted the cover on a panel on the side of the console and flicked the emergency alarm switch.

"You explain the situation to Pierre and the others," he said over the whoop of the alarm signal, "and get Pierre to start moving the Dragon Slayer over the mound formation. I will try to get some sort of reply back as fast as I can."

Seiko fixed up her screen with all the pictures displayed so she would be ready when the rest of the crew came boiling into the main deck to see what the emergency was. Within a few seconds Abdul had swiveled the laser radar to illuminate the east pole directly below them, while its operational frequency had been pushed up to the short ultraviolet. Because he had nothing better immediately at hand, Abdul had the computer play back the pictures that had been sent up from the surface. While they were pulsing down at a megahertz rate, he quickly pulled in the first picture that he had beamed down, showing the Dragon Slayer and the six tidal compensators above Dragon's Egg. He added an arrow that curved over to a position above the mound formations, and had the computer send that down to the east pole. He then swiveled the laser back toward the strange starlike formation, and had it repeat the message twice, alternating between ultraviolet and light output. Since they had seen his first messages they should be able to detect it one way or the other. This time Abdul hoped that nobody would die of boredom waiting for the next pulse.
