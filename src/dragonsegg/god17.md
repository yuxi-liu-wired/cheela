Cesar was busy at the science experiments console. Now that they had settled in over the east magnetic pole, it was time to start the survey instruments. The IR and UV scanners were busy, and the high resolution visible camera was taking shot after shot of small regions in the mountainous territory in the east pole region. Even the neutrino and gravitational radiation detectors were operational on the possibility that a crustquake might occur, although the chances of that happening were not high.

Cesar now readied the laser radar mapper. He first set it in the short pulse mode to get the best resolution on the mountains directly below Dragon Slayer. He checked over the laser parameters as they appeared on the screen.

    LASER RADAR MAPPER:
    WAVELENGTH 0.3 MICROMETERS
    PULSE WIDTH 1.0 PICOSEC (0.6 MM RESOLUTION)
    PEAK PULSE POWER 1 GW
    PULSE REP RATE 1,000,000 PULSES/SEC
    SPOT SIZE 60 CM DIAMETER.

Satisfied with the setup, Cesar leaned forward. "Proceed with laser radar mapper scan!" he said. "Circular scan from sub-surface point out to five kilometers radius!"

Cesar watched as the screen blanked and the image of Dragon's Egg appeared on the screen. He then saw a track of tiny little circles, each one representing a spot where the laser radar had reflected its beam off the crust of the neutron star, slowly winding its way outward in an ever expanding spiral.

"The spiral scan will take about eight minutes," he murmured to himself. He watched for a few seconds and then his fingers flickered over the keyboard as he moved on to set up the next experiment.
