A fraction of a second later, the pulsed emission started again, and this time the narrow-angle scanner caught it early in its emission period. The semiautomatic search-and-identify circuits kept the scanner focused on the pulsations, while the feature extractor in the frequency analysis circuits activated a correlation program. A strong match was then found between the pulsation pattern of the emissions and the rectangular picture pattern that Abdul had chosen in his attempts at communication with Dragon's Egg. If the computer had been a human, its eyebrows would have raised.

The new correlation was enough to trigger an action circuit. As a result---a millisecond later---humans were called into the loop.

    PERIODIC X-UV EMISSIONâ€”EAST POLE

Seiko glanced up at the computer message across the top of her screen. She was floating too far away from the console to reach any of the keys, so she used audibles, even if they were slower.

"Display!" she commanded, and instantly a replay of the narrow-angle X-ray/ultraviolet scanner was on her screen. She watched the regular blinking of the spot in the middle of the east pole mountains, then glanced up to see that the computer had slowed it down considerably for her.

    1/100,000 REAL TIME

Seiko watched it for a few seconds. The pulsations stopped abruptly. There seemed to be no sense to them.

"Analysis!" she commanded.

The picture on the screen stayed, while the computer overprinted result after result of its analysis.

    POSITION 0.1 DEG W LONG, 2.0 DEG N LAT
    SPECTRUM MODIFIED THERMAL, 15,000 K
    MODULATION SIMILAR TO DRAGON'S EGG COMM PICTURE
    NO IDENTIFIABLE NATURAL SOURCE

Seiko scanned down the list and stiffened in shock. She expertly twisted her body in a midair position-reversal maneuver, caught hold of the edge of the console and pulled herself up to it. Her fingers flew over the keys. Within a few seconds, Swift-Killer's second message was building up on her screen.

"Abdul!" she called to the next console, where Abdul Nkomi Farouk was laboriously working out a new message. "They are answering!"
