## SATURDAY 13 JUNE 2020
It was Saturday evening. Donald and Jacqueline sat on the grass of the Griffith Observatory and talked. They were much more relaxed than they had been for months. Jacqueline's thesis was completed, and her formal oral defense the day before had been a mere formality, what with the world-wide scientific acclaim and video-news publicity being made over the discovery.

"I still don't understand why Sawlinski is doing the video-news interviews," Donald said with a frown. "You were the one who discovered the neutron star first, not he."

"That is not the way science works," Jacqueline explained. "A Professor starts a research project hoping to discover something new. The student sometimes makes the discovery, but without the Professor's research project, the discovery would not have been made. Since the Professor gets the blame if the project is a failure, he should get the benefit from any successes. Besides, it doesn't upset me---after all, my career is off to a great start!"

Donald only felt a greater admiration for the woman of whom he had become so fond. He kept silent and continued to look upward at the stars.

After a long time, Jacqueline spoke. "I wonder if we could ever go visit Dragon's Egg. At the speed it is traveling, it will be gone from the Solar System in a few hundred years. I wish I could go myself, but I guess maybe it will be my grandchild or great-grandchild."

"We may be going sooner than you think," Donald said. "The latest news on the Nigerian magnetic monopole discovery is that they have used the first monopole in a large magnetic accelerator to generate other monopoles, and some of those have already been used as a catalyst for a deuterium fusion reaction. The JPL engineers are excited about the fusion results. They are already starting to design fusion-rocket concepts for interstellar spacecraft. I don't think a ship will be ready soon enough so that you and I could go for a visit, but I wouldn't be surprised if, in twenty or thirty years, one of our children will be looking down at Dragon's Egg from a close orbit."

And inevitably, the years passed...
