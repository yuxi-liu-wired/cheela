Not many saw the faint star as Bright's Messenger left it at the center of Six Eyes. It had been too faint to see when it was in its high orbit above the star, since it did not have a glow of its own like the other stars in the sky. But once it was basking in the glow of Six Eyes, the speck reflected their radiance and could be seen by those worshipers of Bright with the best eyesight or the most faith.

"The new star in the center of Six Eyes does not move," the Chief Astrologer reported to Bright's-First, the High Priest. "The Six Eyes are almost motionless---however, they do rotate once every turn about the east pole. The new inner star is at the exact center of Six Eyes and does not move at all."

The High Priest was pleased with the news. Finally something logical was happening in the skies above Bright's Heaven.

"If the new star does not move in the sky, then it is like Bright---who also does not move. Many generations ago Bright sent down six of his eyes to keep careful watch on the unfaithful cheela of that time. It seems that Bright has approved of what he has been seeing, and he has sent down his inner eye of faith to look upon those who have been worshiping him for so long. This new eye is the Inner Eye of Bright."
