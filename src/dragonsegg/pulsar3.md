## FRIDAY 1 MAY 2020
As the days passed, Jacqueline and Donald spent many hours poring over the command time line. It was a long sequence, with even longer delays in it.

"Why can't we leave the low frequency radio on high digitalization rate while the X-ray telescope is scanning?" Jacqueline asked. "That way, if the X-ray telescope picks up something unusual, we can check the low frequency radio to see if the scruff is active."

Donald paged the screen to the section describing the operational characteristics of the low frequency radio digitalization block. "The X-ray telescope uses a lot of power, especially when it is in the scanning mode," he said. "I'm afraid that, because of the age of the radioisotope power generators, the voltage on the power bus will drop so much that the low frequency radio digitalization will blank out if we ask it to keep operating at its highest rate."

"How fast can it operate?" Jacqueline asked.

"Well," Donald said as he looked through the table, "it was minimum-voltage designed for an upper rate of eight times a second, and we have it pushed all the way to sixteen times per second. With the low voltage on the bus, we ought to come back to either eight or four times per second."

"Leave it sixteen times a second," said Jacqueline firmly. "No data is preferable to poor data."

Donald looked at her with a slightly bewildered expression as if he were seeing past her pretty face for the first time. He started to protest, but decided against it and made the short change in the command sequence as she wanted it.

Slowly the command was assembled. Jacqueline and Donald worked on it periodically during the day when Donald was charging to Sawlinski's account. They also talked about it over lunch and in the evenings, when Sawlinski's budget received an extra dividend of Donald's time.
