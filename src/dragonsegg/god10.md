"The compensator masses are down," Carole said, turning to Pierre. "Now it is Dragon Slayer's turn."

Pierre, ignoring the small screen pager on his wrist, reached over to a nearby console. "Page crew of Dragon Slayer!"

The console blinked.

    PAGING CESAR RAMIREZ WONG
    PAGING JEAN KELLY THOMAS

    PAGING ABDUL NKOMI FAROUK

Pierre watched as the "Page acknowledged" mark appeared in front of each name. The computer had found them all busy at one task or another onboard the Dragon Slayer. He leaned forward and asked, "Does everything look good for a departure at 0930?" He reached down and flicked the audio output panel to avoid the screen clutter from a multiple response. The computer fed him the positive confirmations one at a time. Dragon Slayer was ready to go.

Kicking off from the console, Pierre floated across the bridge of St. George, then pulled his way down the tunnels to the launching hangar that contained the seven meter sphere that would be his home for the next eight days.
