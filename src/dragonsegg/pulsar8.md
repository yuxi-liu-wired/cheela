In two days the paper was prepared and accepted into the _Astrophysical Letters_ computer. The next day it was on the astrophysical information net, along with a note from the radio astronomers that very weak 199-millisecond pulsations had been detected from a region in the northern skies right at the end of the constellation of Draco. Shortly thereafter, the new ten-meter telescope in China found a faint speck in the sky, and pictures of "The Egg of the Dragon---Sol's Nearest Neighbor" appeared in _Sinica Astrophysica._ The popular press copied the picture---along with the picturesque Chinese name, and soon people were peering up at the night sky, vainly trying to catch a glimpse of "Dragon's Egg," resting just off the end of the constellation Draco, as if the star were a recently laid egg.
