Swift-Killer moved slowly through the compound of the Inner Eye Institute in Bright's Heaven. She was getting old and did not bluster her way directly into the hard direction as she had used to. Instead, she slid obliquely along, letting the bulk of her still huge body do the work against the "lines of magnetic force" that one of Pierre's early science books had taught them about. She made her way to the Sky-Talk Library. It was still under construction, with workers busily assembling low walls with storage bins for the knowledge that had been beaming down from the sky for almost two generations now. There were smaller bins for the tally fringe strings that were the method of recording the pictures early in her job as Keeper of the Sender, and larger ones for the new tasting plates that could accurately record the high resolution, multihued "television" images that the humans were now using.

The taste-plates had also been one of Swift-Killer's many inventions. She had begun to despair over accurately recording all the subtle nuances of the human television signal in the form of knots of various shapes and sizes. She had happened upon the new technique when she had been on inspection after they had broken camp and were moving on to a new station under the westward-drifting human spacecraft. She had flowed through the remains of the kitchen for the camp and her tread moved across an abandoned mixing plate, stained with meat juices and spices. Her ancient hunting senses had sprung into action, attempting to extract every item of information from the complex chemical spoor that it found under her tread. Swift-Killer had experimented and found that her tread could "taste" with higher resolution and comprehension using her ancient spoor-tracking senses than it could feel with her high-sensitivity tactile senses. After a little experimentation to find the most pungent and long-lasting spices, the knowledge of the humans was soon being stored on long-lasting, apparently featureless plates, that burst into a detailed, "full-colored" image as a trained tread flowed onto it.

Swift-Killer approached Sky-Beams, one of her apprentices, who was busily staring upwards at the rapidly blinking Inner Eye, a set of trained tendrils in front of him, shooting drop after drop of spice onto a fresh plate.

Leaving half of his eyes devoted to the recording task, Sky-Beams turned the others toward his mentor. "What are you doing here, O Keeper of the Sender?" Sky-Beams said, his correctly formal address scarcely concealing his annoyance that the Old One was interrupting him.

Swift-Killer knew exactly what was wrong with the youngster. He was ready to become the new Keeper of the Sender, and she was still around. However, it didn't bother her any longer. As she grew older, she grew more mellow and now was actually looking forward to tending eggs and hatchlings. What stories she would tell them!

"I came to bring you good news, Sky-Beams," she said. "The advisory council of the Inner Eye Institute has agreed with my recommendation, and you are now the new Keeper of the Sender."

Swift-Killer flowed over toward him as the tendrils on the younger one hesitated. She started to form a pseudopod to stroke his topside as she had done many times in the past. He seemed perfectly willing, but she found that she was just not interested in sex anymore. She wanted to get to the eggs that were waiting for her. She gave him a friendly brush anyway, then said, "Stay vigilant, Sky-Beams. The work may be tedious at times, but one never knows but what the next page will bring a new truth to our people."

"I will, my teacher," Sky-Beams said, and turned all his eyes back to the sky as Swift-Killer flowed away in the easy direction, heading for the egg-pens on the east side of Bright's Heaven.

Pierre looked up at the flash in the corner of his screen.

    LINK FROM JEANâ€”LIBRARY

"Accept link!" he said.

    PULLED SECTION ON MATH AND PHYSICS.
    IT IS NOW CUED IN COMPUTER AFTER YOUR BOOKS.
    CONCENTRATED ON PHYSICS OF NEUTRON STARS.
    SLOW GOING, HOWEVER.
    WHAT NEXT?

Pierre thought for a moment. Jean was right. If they spent time searching through the extensive ship's encyclopedia for useful knowledge on the HoloMem crystals, then dumping those sections into the communication computer and out the laser communications console, it would take them forever and a day. A day for the humans and what would seem like forever to the neutron star beings.

"Amalita!" he bellowed, and soon a bloody handkerchief with two eager eyes above it was peering down through the passageway. "Can we hook up the library HoloMem reader directly into the communications console?"

There was a slight pause as Amalita flicked circuit diagrams through her nearly eidetic memory.

"Sorry, Pierre," she said. "The HoloMem crystal reader is hardwired into the library computer. However, the communications console does have the capability of reading or recording a single HoloMem crystal at a time."

"It does?" Pierre said, surprised.

Amalita floated over to the communications console where Abdul was monitoring the latest transmission and flipped open a small door in one side. She reached in and carefully removed a three-sided object. When she pulled it out, Pierre could see the bottom was missing and the interior was a corner cube of brilliantly polished mirrors.

"This is one-half the scanner cavity," Amalita said, "and here is the HoloMem crystal itself." She pushed a button and a clear crystal cube about five centimeters across sprang out of the door, twirling slowly as it floated into the room. The corners and edges of the cube were jet black, but through the clear faces Pierre could see the rainbowlike reflections from the information fringes stored in the interior. Amalita deftly plucked the cube out of the air, her thumb and forefinger grasping it at opposite corners.

"This has been storing everything that has gone through the console since we started," she said. "It is exactly the same size as one of the encyclopedia HoloMems and we can put one of them in place of this one and read the encyclopedia down one crystal at a time. It will take about a minute to switch crystals and check the scanner adjustments, and about half an hour to read out each one of the 25 encyclopedia crystals, but that should still be faster than shoving all those bits from the library computer through the communications computer to the console."

"Good!" Pierre said. "Go get the first encyclopedia crystal and start with that."

"A to AME, AME to AUS, AUS to BLO, BLO to..." muttered Amalita as she twirled down through the passageway to the library, her trained legs and feet propelling her as efficiently as her hands, which were still busy holding the HoloMem crystal and the corner of the laser scanner cavity.

"A complete education, from Astronomy to Zoology," Pierre mused. "Alphabetical order may not be the best way to teach someone, but in this case it is the fastest."
