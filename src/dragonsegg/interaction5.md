Seiko was watching the image of the decorated cheela on the screen. Soother's-Worry was in the midst of one of his confused sentences when suddenly there was a large crowd of cheela surrounding him. She caught a glimpse of glittering knives of dragon crystal as the computer-fed display stopped. Almost instantly the screen flashed on again. There was no trace of Soother's-Worry, and the very plain topside of a cheela again was centered on her screen, the dozen eye-stubs waving smoothly as the intelligent-looking eyes stared intently at the optical pickup.

"I am Leonardo, the Chief Scientist of the Sky Talk science complex," the image said. "I have been appointed the new Keeper of the Comm by the Leader of All Clans."

Not a flicker of surprise crossed Seiko's stolid face. One minute ago, the ruler of this world had been called Soother-of-All-Clans. Now they were back to the old title of Leader. Well, they were probably going through their equivalent of the consolidation of China by Ch'in or of Europe by Napoleon, and one would have to expect rapid changes for a while until they had left their semibarbaric state and had settled down to a method for transition of rule by peaceful means.

"Welcome, Leonardo," Seiko said, slightly amused. The name was probably inherited with the job as Chief Scientist. Right now the cheela were in awe of the accomplishments of the humans and often took names from the encyclopedia the humans were sending down. Within half a day, they would have surpassed the humans in knowledge and technology. She doubted that she would meet any Leonardos or Einsteins on her next shift.

"We are about through with the HoloMem crystal GAM to GRE and we will have to take a short break while we load in the next one," Seiko said.

"Good," said the computer-slowed image of Leonardo. "That will give us a chance to install the new radiation to taste converters."
