## 05:50 CREW TIME 22 JUNE 2050<br/>(00:45 GMT SUNDAY 25 DECEMBER 2050)
 
The four tanks were crowded into the cargo air lock on St. George, and soon the lock was full of balls of water and sloppy, wet, sobbing people.

"I'm sorry about Amalita and Abdul, Carole," Pierre said as he took off his mask. "If only there was something I could..."

"Hush..." Carole was smiling happily. "Come! I want you to meet a couple of friends of ours." She grabbed his hand and pulled him down the corridor to the communications room. The room was empty except for the communications operator. Pierre was completely baffled.

"Hello, Pierre." It was Amalita's voice.

"Did you have a nice ride up from Egg?" Abdul's voice asked.

Pierre whirled around to face a communications screen at one end of the room. He saw video images of Amalita and Abdul in two segments of the screen.

"Surprise! Surprise!" Abdul yelled.

"It _really_ is us," Amalita said. "Or at least all of us that counts."

"I even have a moustache to twirl." Abdul lifted his hand to twirl the end of his long moustache. "And it feels like the real thing even though it's made of software instead of hardware."

Carole squeezed Pierre's arm in reassurance as she spoke. "The cheela scanned them thoroughly just before their bodies were destroyed," she said. "Their intellect patterns now reside in cheela supercomputers."

"But Amalita was irradiated and frozen," Pierre protested.

"I admit I have a lot of missing memories," said Amalita. "But the basic personality is still there."

"Yeah!" said Abdul. "She's just as bossy as ever."

"Hush!"

"See?" said Abdul, raising his eyebrows and shrugging his shoulders. "She'll be even more bossy when we get into those walk-around bodies they're building for us."

"We have slowed ourselves down so we can say goodbye to all of you and our families," said Amalita. "Then we had better get back up to normal cheela rates if we are going to stay up with what is going on down here..."

"Doc! Seiko! Jean!" Abdul called. "Over here on the screen."

Pierre turned around to see astonished looks on the remainder of his crew as they came into the communications room. His chronometer chimed the hour, and he looked down at it. He started to reset it to make it agree with the clock on the wall, but decided against it. Not many people lived on a time-line six months shorter than the rest of the universe.
