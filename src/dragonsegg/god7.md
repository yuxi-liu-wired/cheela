Bright's-Second had been keeping a careful watch on the collection of six lights ever since he had been a novice. Having entered the priesthood because he was withdrawn and unpopular, he had submerged himself in the astrologer sticks and had invented new tools to measure more accurately the minute motions of the many lights piercing the darkness. He was the first to notice that the tiny circle that Bright made in the sky had become measurably smaller. He took the news to Bright's-First, who was delighted.

"That must mean that the imperfection in Bright, miniscule as it has been, is becoming smaller," she said. "When will be the time that Bright is perfect? Oh that I might live to see the turn!"

"I am afraid that when that turn comes, we will both be meat, O High Priest of Bright," the Chief Astrologer said. "Entire clans will have come and gone before Bright reaches its perfection."

The High Priest was disappointed, but she didn't let it show. "Well, we must maintain our stewardship and keep Bright's Temple going until that turn comes and the people once again return to their One True God."

The Chief Astrologer listened politely, but was bursting to tell the High Priest the other news that he had.

"My new sticks have also informed me that something else is happening," he said. "The Six... I mean, the six newer lights are slightly shifting in position and are drawing closer and closer to the point where Bright's Messenger reaches its farthest distance from Egg. Also, if you watch The Six and Bright's Messenger as often as I do, you will see that they do not stay at the same brightness from turn to turn, but occasionally flare up slightly, then return to their original level."

"What can that mean?" Bright's-First asked.

"I don't know, but in about a great of turns, Bright's Messenger will reach its maximum distance from Egg, and it seems as if all six of the other lights will be there at the same time. If so, something interesting may happen."
