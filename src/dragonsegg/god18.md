"I don't want to complain, but I don't want him around," the clan astrologer complained to Sharp-Slicer. "When you first sent Pink-Eyes to apprentice with me, I was willing to give him a try, even if he does look strange. He was eager, and tried very hard, but when we found out that his eyes are so poor that Bright and the Eyes are only blurs, and that he cannot even see most of the other stars in the sky, it was obvious that he could never be an astrologer. If you cannot see the stars, then how can you make astrological predictions?

"Despite that," the clan astrologer went on, "I did find him useful in helping me with the worship services. His voice is high, but the ripples carry well. I use him for all the chants, and have him take care of the worship symbols. But now, I am afraid that I will have to get rid of him. He's blasphemous."

"What!" exclaimed Sharp-Slicer.

"Yes," the clan astrologer said. "For a long time, as an apprentice, he kept saying that the Inner Eye of Bright was flashing on and off. We finally convinced him that it was just his poor eyesight tricking him, but recently he has been saying that every dozen turns or so, the flashes get brighter and brighter, and then fade away again. The last time occurred a few turns ago. He even dragged me up to the top of his silly hill and kept saying to me, 'Look at them! Look at those brilliant flashes! Are you blind, Old One!'

"I don't mind being called an Old One, for it is not long before I will get to play with the hatchlings," the clan astrologer went on. "But to be called blind by that nearly sightless freak is more than I can stand. Besides, he is going around telling everyone that Bright's Inner Eye is signaling to him---him alone!"

Sharp-Slicer looked at the seven points of light hanging nearly motionless over the east pole. She did not often look at the sky, as she was too preoccupied with running the clan here on the crust. However, if there had been bright flashes from the Inner Eye, she certainly would have noticed them. She normally did not pay much attention to religion, but, as Leader of the Clan, she was automatically Chief Worshiper of Bright at holy times, and it wouldn't do to let things be disrupted by an obviously deranged individual.

"I guess the Bright's Afflicted has other problems besides paleness and poor eye sight," she said. "However, times are good, so we will just let him get by without having to do any work."

Pink-Eyes was not happy with his new status. He felt worthless, and spent most of his time off away from the clan camp, gazing at the blurry shapes of Bright and the Eyes, talking to the spots of light and himself, and dreaming that he was Leader of the Combined Clans, speaking to the multitudes that gathered around him to hear his words of wisdom.
