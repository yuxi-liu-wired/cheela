## TUESDAY 5 MAY 2020
The Deep Space Network spent five minutes (and many rubles) to launch the command into space. The five light-minute long string of radio pulses traveled for over a day before it reached the OE probe 200 AU away in its high arc over the Sun. The command was stored, and the spacecraft computer rapidly computed the check sum. It found no obvious errors, but the string of bits was treated like a potentially dangerous cancer virus. It was not allowed to get into the command mechanism just yet, for if there were something wrong in that string of bits, it could kill the spacecraft just as surely as a meteor strike. A copy of the bit stream stored in the holding memory was sent back to Earth. There the copy of the copy was checked with the original. Finally, another copy of the original command string, followed by a separate execute command, was sent out to reassure the OE probe that it could now change its operational state.

Jacqueline was waiting when the next data dump came into the computer. It was nearly midnight---a typical working hour for a graduate student---only now she was not as lonely as she had been in previous months when she had sat at this console in the early morning hours.

"Looks like a good dump," said Donald as he watched the Deep Space Network report build up on his screen.

Jacqueline turned to smile at him, but was interrupted by another, less kindly voice.

"Clean up the low frequency radio data and do a quick plot on the screen," Professor Sawlinski commanded.

Jacqueline's practiced fingers flew over the keyboard, and soon the computer was rearranging the data from spacecraft format to plotting format. There was a lot of data now that the digitalization rate had been increased, and it took some time.

"Here it comes," said Donald, as he watched the plot start to build up on Jacqueline's screen. The complex, humped pattern of the low frequency radio variations snaked their way across the display, crowding all their variations into a few inches of screen. Jacqueline peered closely at the display and slowly the greenish white line changed texture, as if it were going out of focus.

"The scruff is starting," she said.

They all looked as the slow variations became almost submerged in a flurry of noise.

Jacqueline noted the time of onset of the scruff and stopped the slowly moving plot with a few strokes of the _delete_ key. A few more commands, and soon a new plot came on the screen. This time the sinusoidal variations were well spaced, and the scruff was now a distinct pulsation.

"It is definitely periodic!" Sawlinski said. "Expand it further!"

In the next plot, the slow variations that were the basis of Jacqueline's thesis had been reduced to a gradually increasing trend line. And on that line there marched a series of noisy spikes, as equally separated as soldiers in a parade, but varying greatly in their size.

"It certainly looks just like a pulsar," exclaimed Sawlinski. "What is the period?"

"I'll run a spectral analysis of this section," Jacqueline said.

Soon the spectral analysis was on the screen. There was a lot of noise and some sideband spikes, but there was no doubt that the data centered predominantly at a frequency of 5.02 Hertz or a period of 199 milliseconds.

"Something that regular can only be manmade---or a pulsar," said Sawlinski. "I want you to find the other sections of scruff and see if the periods are the same. If they are, see if one section of scruff keeps in step with the beat set up by the preceding sections. I will check the library to get the latest data on pulsars." He went across the room and activated another console.

Jacqueline peered at the screen and said, "If you are going to look up pulsar periods, I would say that the period is 199.2 milliseconds, although the last number could be off by a few digits."

By the time Sawlinski had put the console into library mode and had obtained a list of the known pulsars with periods of less than one second, Jacqueline had determined that the pulses indeed kept very exact time. Although they faded away and reappeared a day later as the spacecraft slowly rotated, the new line of marching pulses was still in step with the first batch. She followed the pulses through the whole set of data. They kept accurate time during the whole week.

"The period is now 0.1992687 seconds and seems to be good to at least six places," Jacqueline said as Sawlinski glanced at her.

He looked through the tables of pulsar periods on his screen. "There are no known pulsars with that period," he said. "Yet it must be a pulsar. If we only knew exactly where to look, maybe the radio telescopes here on Earth could find it."

Jacqueline finally decided to tell him of her decision to add an additional command to the original one. "Professor Sawlinski," she said, "while Donald and I were working out the details of the command to the spacecraft to have it speed up its data digitalization rate, we realized that the length of the command made no difference to the cost of sending the command. We also figured that, after a week of high rate data, we would have obtained most of the information on the nature of the high frequency scruff, and we could then have the spacecraft do something else."

"What did you do!" Sawlinski barked at her.

Jacqueline faced him and patiently explained. "After a week of data collection at high rate, we programmed the spacecraft to continue at a high data rate, but to switch cyclically between the four antenna arms. I hoped that the scruff would show up more on one arm than another, and we could at least tell from what quadrant of the sky the signal was coming from."

Sawlinski's face glowered while he thought over what she had told him. Finally he relaxed and said, _"Horosho!"_ He then turned to Donald and asked for the time of the next data dump.

"One week from now, minus about a half-hour."

_"Horosho._ I will see you both then," he said. "Meanwhile, Jacqueline, you had better get this information ready for publication in _Astrophysical Letters._ We will want the period, the apparent strength, and anything else you can extract out of the data. We will hold off sending it in for review until we have had a chance to see next week's data. _Dobri vecher."_ He turned on his heel and left them.
