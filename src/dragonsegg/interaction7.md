The chimes rang again and again, insistently. Pierre woke up grudgingly, his red-lined eyes peering at the numbers on the clock.

2030, the numbers indicated.

"I missed my shift!" Pierre exclaimed, slapping the release and running an index finger down the sealing seam of the sleeping sack. As his brain became more active, he realized that shifts no longer counted, but he still should be awake and helping.

"Six hours," he groaned as he rubbed his face. "Six hours---and three-fourths of a millennium. I wonder what is going on?" He quickly bathed, and, still holding a food-stick, swung up the passageway to the back of the communications console.

Abdul looked up as he came in. "Glad to see you, Pierre," he said in a concerned voice. "Did you get some sleep?"

"Yes," Pierre replied. "Enough to keep me awake for the rest of my shift. Thanks for standing in for me."

"No problem," Abdul said. "It has been interesting watching the cheela civilization develop almost right in front of my eyes."

"At what stage are the cheela now?" Pierre asked.

"They are beginning to pass us in all areas except molecular chemistry. But since they don't even have molecules to experiment on, you can't blame them for that. They tell us that they can almost predict the contents of the rest of the encyclopedia, but they insist that we send the entire text down for the sake of their historians and humanologists. We should be changing to the last encyclopedia crystal WAT to ZYZ shortly. Then you should erase the encyclopedia crystals and the cheela will start filling them up with information that they have learned on their own in the past day."

"Good," Pierre said. "Amalita and I can take it from here. You had better get some rest yourself."

"I won't take long," Abdul said as he floated out the door. "This is too interesting to miss."
