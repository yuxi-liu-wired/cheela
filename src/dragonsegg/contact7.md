Seiko's announcement came as no real surprise to Pierre. He had suspected the time differential from the surprising rapidity with which the mounds had risen. There was no question in his mind that the job of communication with another race took priority over any other scientific mission, and without hesitation he went to the propulsion console and initiated the move from the east pole to the mound formations ninety degrees around Dragon's Egg. Because of the mass of the tidal compensators, and the necessity that they all move together to keep the tides from harming the fragile human flesh inside the Dragon Slayer, the move had to be done slowly. As soon as the new position was set into the propulsion command subsystem, he pushed himself from the console chair and floated over to join the group hanging in the air around Seiko and Abdul.

"We should be shifted to the new position in half-an-hour," he reported as he joined them.

Without looking up from her screen, Seiko said, "At a million to one, that will take the equivalent of sixty years."

Pierre had already made the calculation himself, but there was no way that he could make the move any faster, the herder probe propulsion systems for the tidal compensators were not made for speed. He gave a quiet shrug, which looked odd on a body that was floating in midair.

"We have a more serious problem," he said, addressing the whole crew. "After we get there, what are we going to say?"

Seiko spoke up, her eyes still on the screen. "There is no way that we can carry on a two-way conversation with a million-to-one time difference. By the time we can think of anything intelligent to say, the person down there who asked the question would have died."

"It's not that bad," Pierre said. "Of course we don't know how long they live, but if they last seventy of their type years, then..." He paused to think and Seiko finished for him.

"There are pi times ten million seconds in a year, times 70 years is 2200 million seconds, which is 2200 sec or about 37 minutes of our time."

"Well, that isn't so bad," Jean said. "At least we can talk with a person for long enough to get to know him."

"He is going to get awfully tired devoting his entire life to a casual conversation with you," Seiko retorted.

Pierre took charge. "We are going to have to come up with material for our side of the conversation, and we are probably going to need more than one communication link going at a time. Abdul, how many communication links can we set up?"

Without turning from the console, Abdul replied, "We have been using the laser radar mapper as a communication link, but it isn't designed for that job. It has a pulsed modulator and can't handle high bit rates. The microwave sounder is also available, and I think its modulator can handle up to 100 megahertz. The laser communicator would be ideal, since it can handle a few gigahertz modulation, which at a million to one, would be like the bandwidth of a telephone line; you could send slow facsimile pictures through it, but nothing like a television picture. Unfortunately, the laser communication antennas were never designed to point at the surface of Dragon's Egg; they are on the main body and one or the other is always pointed out at St. George."

"We will have to make do with the laser radar mapper and the microwave sounder until we can get one of the laser communicator dishes reoriented," Pierre said. He turned in midair and surveyed the faces hanging in the air around him until he found the one he wanted.

"Amalita," he said, "put on your suit and get one of those laser communicators dishes pointing at Dragon's Egg. Meanwhile, I will be contacting St. George and tell them we are going to cut off one of the laser communication links with them."

A voice broke in from the communications console around on the other side of the central core.

"We have been monitoring, Dragon Slayer." The speaker was Commander Swenson. "Continue your course of action."

Amalita pushed off to the suit room. As she went, she called over her shoulder. "I am sure I can mount the communication dish on the laser mapper mount," she said. "I can't guarantee the boresight accuracy, but they should be fairly close."

Pierre turned to Jean. "I want you to go through the ship's library for anything that is designed for initial contact with other species. Look in the fiction HoloMem for science fiction stories if you have to, but I think that somewhere in the ship's encyclopedia you might find something on communication languages."

"Meanwhile, we will have to have something to send while Jean is searching the data banks. I will put my children's books into a computer file for Abdul to put on the communication links. I'll start with the most elementary books first, then build up to the more adult ones."

"But they all presume some sort of prior knowledge," Cesar protested. "Even your A-B-C books assume the reader knows what an apple is."

"They will work if we send all the art work with it," Pierre said, going around to the console on the other side of the main deck. "Don't forget, they are going to have lots and lots of time to figure out what each page means while they wait for the next one to print out slowly on their equivalent of a facsimile machine."

Cesar left to check out Amalita's suit before she exited. Abdul had finished sending the crude pictures, and was monitoring the story file that Pierre was building up in the computer.

Suddenly Seiko announced, "They are replying again. This time it is to the west of the east pole mountains."

Moving rapidly, Abdul read off the coordinates that the computer had flashed at the top of Seiko's screen and keyed them into his communication console. Almost instantly the laser radar was repositioned to beam down to that point, and the messages continued to trickle slowly down to the surface.
