The console screen flashed, and Cesar looked up. Across the top of the screen appeared the words:

    LASER RADAR MAPPER SCAN COMPLETE.

Cesar struck a few keys and the IR image that he had been examining disappeared and was replaced with the command setup for the laser radar mapping experiment.

For the next segment of the scan, the laser beam would be shooting obliquely across the curved surface of Dragon's Egg, and the equipment could now obtain both high resolution height and surface position information if it were set up to use a chirped pulse. Soon the laser was chirping in frequency from the visible up to the ultraviolet region, while the pulse repetition rate was lowered to 100,000 pulses per second.

Cesar set up the laser mapper to scan a one radian sector, starting from the edge of the five-kilometer circle that he had already mapped and extending out for another five kilometers---well over the curve of Dragon's Egg. He then watched as the sector scan started, the narrow fan beam taking about one second per sweep as it slowly crept outward toward the west.
