It was nearly time for Pink-Eyes to leave the hatchling pen when Loud-Talker died. Loud-Talker was in the midst of his favorite activity; telling stories to the hatchlings. He was recounting the tale of the time he had led the forces of the Combined Clans in a punitive raid to drive back the barbarians in the north. He was just getting to the good part, where he personally hacked up a dozen barbarians at one time (the number of barbarians seemed to increase with each telling), when a fluid pump to his brain-knot failed. The constant muscular tension in his skin relaxed, and his body spread into a large, limp circle that flowed out and in between the hatchlings.

Pink-Eyes was shocked. This was not the first Old One that he had seen die, but the loss of his special friend and mentor was a great blow. He stayed rooted to the spot, not even moving when the butchering crew came to get the body. He was still there when the hatchlings returned from watching Loud-Talker converted into meat for the food bins.

While the others were busy eating, Pink-Eyes wandered out the opening of the hatchling pen and went slowly off to climb a small mound just outside the clan camp.

As a leader of a clan that inhabited the eastern border of Bright's Empire, Sharp-Slicer always kept half her tread listening to the constant murmurs in the crust. Her clan was subject to many attacks by the barbarians, and although she had good warriors out on watch duty, she never relaxed. She paused now as something unusual rippled through the crust under her tread. It was very faint, and very high-pitched. It was not a sentry alarm, but it definitely didn't sound like the usual busy noises of the clan camp.

The strange ripple sounded like a voice from a hatchling pen, but her trained directional senses placed it well outside the camp boundaries. She moved to the edge of the camp where the high-pitched ripple now came more clearly. She then saw the source, a faint pale spot on top of a nearby rise. Sharp-Slicer moved toward it; as she got closer, she realized that the pale spot was the Bright's Afflicted hatchling, Pink-Something-or-Other.

She was annoyed that the hatchling had been allowed to wander off this far from the camp, but then again, there had been some confusion at the hatchling pen when Loud-Talker had flowed. Besides, the hatchling was probably old enough by now to be given some work, although Sharp-Slicer had a hard time thinking of what such a small, poorly-sighted one could do.

As Sharp-Slicer approached the base of the rise, she could hear the high-pitched voice through the crust. She was surprised at how well the tiny ripples seemed to travel. She stopped to listen.

"O Bright One in the sky. Why do you punish me so, for I have done nothing wrong. I have always worshiped you as I should," Pink-Eyes said. "You have inflicted this miserable pale body upon me---and now you have taken my only friend. Why? Oh why?"

Sharp-Slicer was a little bewildered that the youngster seemed so attached to the Old One. She had respected Loud-Talker herself. After all, anyone would respect an ex-Leader of the Combined Clans. But he was meat now---there was nothing left to respect. She supposed that this unseemly sorrow over a hunk of meat was just one of the many strange things that was wrong with the poor youngster. She rumbled a call in his direction.

"You---come down at once, and return to the compound!" she said. "You know there are barbarians not far away."

Pink-Eyes was startled at the voice booming through the crust, for his eyes had been busy trying to make out the blur that was all he could see of Bright, and he had not noticed the Clan Leader's approach. He was awed at being addressed personally by the Leader of the Clan, and quickly flowed down the hill and started back to the camp, but a command from Sharp-Slicer brought him to a stop.

"Wait!" Sharp-Slicer said. "Since you now feel that you can just wander out of the hatchling pen whenever you want to, perhaps you are too big for the hatchery. What is your name and age, youngster?"

"My name is Pink-Eyes and I have aged a dozen greats of turns, O Leader of the Clan," Pink-Eyes responded respectfully.

Sharp-Slicer flowed over and looked at him closely. He was small, much too small for training as a warrior or hunter, and even too small for tending crops. She was going to have a hard time finding something useful for this one to do. She finally had an idea.

"You are to go to the clan astrologer and tell him that the Leader of the Clan said that you are to train to be an apprentice astrologer," she ordered.

Pink-Eyes was delighted that he had finally been given something useful to do, and immediately flowed off toward the astrologers' compound.

Sharp-Slicer watched the eager youngster flow off, and then returned to more important business, having never connected the pale youngster with the pale egg that she had left at the egg-pen so long ago.
