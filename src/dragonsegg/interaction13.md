"It is time for the Visit," announced Clear-Thinker at one of the planning sessions. "Get out the skimmer and check the mush tube and waste disposal systems."

The skimmer was a small vehicle especially designed for the Visit. It was not much larger than an instrument shell and had only rudimentary propulsion and control subsystems. A standard individual shell was much larger, and needed a larger mini-black hole to keep it from exploding. Such shells had to stay over a meter away from the viewing ports since their gravity fields were so high. The skimmer was much less massive, so it could approach much closer to the ports. The skimmer had two things that an individual shell did not normally carry, however: a half-dozen turns worth of food, most of it in the form of a liquid mush, and a disposal grate connected to a holding tank.

Most of the crew had the decency to busy themselves elsewhere as the commander of the Visit expedition settled himself onto the skimmer. The spherical shell of the skimmer was only slightly larger than his body, so there was only one way that he could fit on it. With the controls at his front, his food intake orifice was situated near the tube from the mush tanks, while his elimination orifice was over the disposal grid.

Clear-Thinker formed some crystalline bones within his body, conformed them into manipulators, took hold of the controls and raised power.

"Never has a nickname for a spacecraft fit so well," thought Clear-Thinker, as the "Flying Toilet" rose from the main expedition spacecraft and moved over to the left viewing port where it stopped---just a bit less than a meter from the tip of Pierre's nose.
