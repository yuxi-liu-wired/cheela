Pierre focused his eyes on the tiny white-hot speck floating in front of him on the other side of the deeply tinted glass. The skimmer itself was an iridescent sphere about five millimeters in diameter. Almost covering the hemisphere on the side toward him was the opalescent body of Clear-Thinker. The various portions of his body changed color like an incandescent drop of liquid crystal, as the hot internal fluid currents and cooler radiative surfaces varied their temperature. Spaced around the periphery of the flattened ellipsoidal body were a dozen red pinpoint eyes glowing like tiny coals around a tiny campfire.

"Like a flattened miniature scallop on the half-shell," Pierre thought. "Although scallops don't have manipulators and their eyes are blue."

As his eyes and the humming automatic cameras took in the sight of Clear-Thinker patiently enduring his vigil outside the viewport, the speaker on the communication console spoke Clear-Thinker's greeting.

"Hello, Pierre."

As the echo of the last syllable floated across the console room, there was a flash of light and the incandescent speck was gone, leaving only a yellow-green afterimage on Pierre's retina. It was only after the gravity pull had lifted that Pierre finally realized that his nose ached from being squashed up to the window at three gees.
