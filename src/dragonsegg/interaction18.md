Leaving Amalita talking to Sky-Teacher at the communications console on the main deck, Pierre dived smoothly through the hole in the floor to the lower deck and pulled himself over to the library console. He moved carefully, for between two fingers he was carrying a precious HoloMem crystal containing all the wisdom of the cheela that had accumulated during the past thirty minutes. He carefully placed the crystal in its scanner cavity in the library console, fitted the brilliantly polished corner segment into place, and closed the cover.

According to their conversations with the robot cheela communicator, this latest HoloMem crystal had a large section on the internal structure of neutron stars. Pierre had the computer jump rapidly through the millions of pages until he found a detailed cross section of the interior of Dragon's Egg. The diagram showed that the star had an outer surface that was a solid crust of nuclei; neutron-rich isotopes of iron, zinc, nickle, and other elements in a crystalline lattice, through which flowed a liquid sea of electrons. Next came the mantle---two kilometers of neutrons and iron nuclei that became more neutron-rich with depth. The inner three-fourths of the star was a liquid ball of superfluid neutrons and superfluid protons. At the very center was a small core of esoteric elementary particles whose normally short lifetimes were lengthened by the extreme pressures and densities inside the star.

Pierre looked carefully at the symbols for the elementary particles. Most were known to him, but there was one that he had never seen before. He looked at the legend to one side and saw that the symbol referred to an "Elysium" particle. The cheela had found an elementary particle inside their star that the humans had not yet seen in their atom smashers! Pierre quickly keyed the library console to search through the HoloMem crystal for more information on the Elysium particle. In a fraction of a second, his screen flashed:

> PROPERTIES AND USES OF ELYSIUM PARTICLE—FURTHER INFORMATION ON THIS PARTICLE IS ENCRYPTED. THE KEY IS THE MASS AND LIFETIME OF THE FIRST EIGHT ELEMENTARY PARTICLES (INCLUDING THE ELYSIUM PARTICLE) TO FIVE SIGNIFICANT FIGURES.

The rest of the section was gibberish.

Pierre mused. The cheela could have told the humans about the particle, but had decided not to. The human race was going to have to find that particle by itself and learn enough about its mass and lifetime so that they could decrypt the section and read what the cheela had learned about it.

Of course, if the humans did their research correctly, they would know practically everything that was now hidden behind the gibberish, but if they had gotten off on the wrong track, then the knowledge the cheela had left would correct them before they went on to learn more about the universe that they lived in.

"Just like a good teacher," Pierre thought. "You give the students a start by letting them know there is something interesting to learn in a certain area, let them learn about it on their own, then finally check over their results and give them any correction necessary."

As he flipped back to the section on neutron star interiors, he mused that a cryptogram with only sixteen five-digit numbers could probably be broken by a large computer in an exhaustive search, but he figured that the human race would be too proud to peek.

His console screen returned to the original diagram of the interior of Dragon's Egg. Pierre scanned the next page. It was a photograph of a neutron star, but it wasn't Dragon's Egg. He could tell it was a real photograph, since he could see a portion of a cheela on a space flitter in the foreground. His eyes widened and he rapidly scanned page after page. There were many photographs, each followed by detailed diagrams of the internal structure of the various neutron stars. They ranged the gamut from very dense stars that were almost black holes to large bloated neutron stars that had a neutron core and a white-dwarf-star exterior. Some of the names were unfamiliar, but others, like the Vela pulsar and the Crab Nebula pulsar, were neutron stars known to the humans.

"But the Crab Nebula pulsar is over 3000 light-years away!" Pierre exclaimed to himself. "They would have had to travel faster than the speed of light to have gone there to take those photographs in the past eight hours!"

A quick search through the index found the answer.

> FASTER-THAN-LIGHT PROPULSION—THE CRYPTO-KEY TO THIS SECTION IS ENGRAVED ON A PYRAMID ON THE THIRD MOON OF THE SECOND PLANET OF EPSILON ERIDANI.

There then followed a long section of gibberish.

In near shock, Pierre turned off the console and slowly floated over to the nearby lounge. He was not surprised to find everyone except Amalita there. They were all sitting in the low gravity on the soft circular seat and looking down past their feet out the view port below them. Pierre jumped up to the top of the lounge and held onto the handle in the hatch door leading to one of the high-gravity protection tanks. He too looked down and out the one-meter diameter port set in the bottom of the spacecraft. The electronically controlled density filter had been set to blacken the port thirty times a second as each of the six glowing compensator masses passed in front of the window five times a second. The only light that entered the port was the single point of intense brightness that was the sun---their home---2120 AU away.

Pierre broke the silence. "It's nearly time for us to leave," he said.

Jean looked up, her perky nose wrinkled in puzzlement. "I thought the plan was for us to stay down here for at least another week," she said.

"With the cheela doing all the mapping and measurements for us, there is really no need for us to stay any longer," he explained. "You should have read the detailed description of both the exterior and interior of Dragon's Egg in that last HoloMem crystal I brought down." He straightened out and swung down to hold himself in the doorway to the lounge.

"I had the computer reprogram the herder probes to move us into the path of the deorbiter mass. In about half a day we will be in proper position to be kicked out of this close orbit back up to St. George. Then we can be heading for home instead of looking at it." He looked up at the clock readout on the lounge wall.

"Time to change HoloMem crystals again," he said. He flexed his knees preparatory to leaping up the passageway to the main deck. He flashed his smile through his beard at them and said, "Come on, there is a lot of work to do to get this ship ready. Amalita and I will finish off the last of the HoloMem crystals, but the rest of you had better start buttoning up the ship; the gravity fields from that deorbiter will turn anything loose into a deadly missile." He jumped upward to the central deck and the others swam out the lounge door and spread out through the ship.

Pierre swung over to the communication console and looked at Sky-Teacher over Amalita's shoulder. The robot cheela was patiently explaining something. Pierre stared in fascination at the image. With the million-to-one time differential, it had not surprised Pierre that the cheela would develop a long-living intelligent robot that could take over the demanding task of talking to the slow-thinking humans. What amazed him was that the robotic creature was so highly developed that it had a personality. It was not robotlike in its mannerisms at all. In fact, it acted very much like a patient, old-time schoolmaster. One could almost hear the friendly smile and the greying hair in the voice. It was a relief to the humans to have Sky-Teacher to talk to. They no longer felt as if they were wasting a good portion of someone's life if they made a mistake or hesitated for a moment.

"We shortly will have filled up all your available HoloMem crystals," Sky-Teacher's image said, its halo of robotic eyes doing a perfect imitation of the traveling wave pattern in a real cheela. "I am afraid that you will find most of this material is encrypted, since we are now the equivalent of many thousands of years ahead of you in development.

"Yet, if it had not been for you, we would still be savages, stagnating in an illiterate haze for thousands or even millions of greats of turns. We owe you much, but we must be careful how we pay you back, for you too have a right to grow and develop on your own. For your own good, it is best that we cut off communication after this last HoloMem crystal is full. We have given you enough material to keep you busy learning for thousands of your years. Then we will both be off on our separate ways, seeking truth and knowledge through space and time. You in worlds where the electron is paramount, and we in worlds where the neutron dominates.

"But please don't despair. We may live much faster than you, but there are only a finite number of fundamental truths to learn about the Universe, so eventually you will catch up to us."

A tone sounded and a small message appeared on the screen.

> HOLOMEM CRYSTAL FULL.

"You are on your own now," Sky-Teacher said, hearing the tone. "But we have one last present for you. You will need tens of thousands of years to develop fully, and minor nuisances like ice ages on your planet would slow you down. While we were exploring the interior of your Sun, we found five small black holes. There were the four that you already know about and a much smaller one. Since they were disturbing the fusion reactions in your Sun, we removed them for you. Now the Sun will stay stable while you are learning from the HoloMem crystals."

"We thank you," Pierre stammered, awed by the power implied by the simple statement.

"And we thank you," Sky-Teacher said. "But it is drawing near the time for you to leave. Goodbye, my friends."

"Goodbye," Pierre said as the screen blanked.

He turned to Amalita. "I'll put away the HoloMem crystal, and you start checking out the acceleration tanks," he said. "It's time to go home!"
