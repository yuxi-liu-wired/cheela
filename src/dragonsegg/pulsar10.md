## SUNDAY 15 AUGUST 2032
Quick-Mover was getting tired. He only hoped the Swift was tiring faster. The Swift was much quieter than he, but its brain was slow, and it never seemed to learn from its repeated failures to catch him. This particular beast had been harassing his clan for the last three turns of the sky, and the clan had been forced to retreat to a cluster of boulders that blocked the Swift's rush. There was nothing they could do until the huge beast tired and went away, or else caught one of them out in the open---like Quick-Mover---who was now beginning to regret his attempt to get a food-pod from a nearby plant.

He watched carefully with six of his eyes as the Swift laboriously moved in the hard direction until it figured it was directly east or west of its intended prey. Once there, it would start accelerating, swiftly slithering toward him as its long narrow body twisted across the crust. As it neared, the great, glowing maw would open, and out from under each of the five eyes ringing the gaping mouth would spring a long, sharp fang of crystal.

Quick-Mover knew how sharp those fangs were, since he had one stored in a tool pouch in his body. He had retrieved the fang from the mangled carcass of a Swift that had been the loser in a mating duel and had used it to cut up the drying carrion that he and his clan had enjoyed as a supplement to their food-pod diet.

The Swift launched its rush. Quick-Mover waited until the Swift had committed itself to its attack; then, thinning his flexible, opalescent body down, he pushed into the hard direction with all the speed that his muscles could command. The Swift was now moving so rapidly that it could not change its course, but it was close. One of Quick-Mover's trailing eyes winced when a fang nicked its thick support stub.

As the Swift slowed its rush and turned to attack again, Quick-Mover became desperate. Soon one of those sharp fangs was going to slash a large hole in him, and the next time the Swift made its rush, it would catch him.

Then suddenly, Quick-Mover had a thought. He had a fang too! He watched the Swift shift position off at a distance and begin its rush. He quickly shaped a section of skin into a short tendril and, reaching into the tool pouch orifice, pulled out the fang. He enlarged the tendril into a strong manipulator, backed up with a thick crystal bone core, and pushed the rest of his body into the hard direction again. This time, he left a portion of his body out in the path of the Swift. It was the thick manipulator holding the fang. Quick-Mover felt a jar, then his eyes glowed as he saw the Swift stumble to a halt, fangs snapping at its flank, where the glowing vital juices poured out onto the crust.

Quick-Mover looked in awe at the fang held in his manipulator. Both were covered with dripping gobs of glowing juice. He sucked them clean, enjoying the unaccustomed taste of fresh juice and meat. He moved over to the still-thrashing Swift. Carefully keeping well off in the hard direction, he watched the Swift as it grew weaker. Finally, feeling bolder, he moved the manipulator with its fang over the center of the long thin body and struck downward. The sharp point sank deep into the body. The Swift, struck in its brain-knot, shivered and flowed into a fleshy pile.

Quick-Mover raised the fang and struck once more.

It felt good.

He was mightier than a Swift! Never again would one of these beasts terrorize his people!

The fang struck again and again and again...
