Super-Fluid was dejected. This turn was to have been one of the greatest moments of his career, and it had been blasted by his meeting with the Council for the Programmed Education of the Slow Ones. The Council had decided that the humans would not be told about Super-Fluid's new theory of gravity. Instead, the humans would have to rediscover it for themselves.

Super-Fluid had wanted to have his new theory appreciated and used by the humans. After all, they had given so much to the cheela. Yet he recognized that the only reason that the cheela were still developing on their own was that the extensive knowledge of the humans had been transmitted down to them so slowly that the faster-thinking cheela had usually figured out things by themselves, long before the detailed human explanation had finally trickled in.

The Council had decreed that his new discoveries on antigravity would have to be sent up to the humans in a coded form. The detailed information on his theory would be in the hands of the humans, but they would not be able to read it until they knew the crypto-keyword that would decipher the gibberish that they had received. The crypto-keyword for the antigravity section was the complete nonlinear formula that Super-Fluid had laboriously developed only after many turns of deep thought.

"It isn't fair," Super-Fluid thought. "Before they can find out what I did, one of the humans will have had to think the same thoughts that I did, and that person will get the credit!"

Yet he knew that, although the human might receive some limited notoriety for breaking the cryptocode to the antigravity section, it would give no real consolation to the person who, after all, had come in second best.

"They are so brave---so noble---those Slow Ones," thought Super-Fluid, as he approached the construction site for the antigravity machine.

Helium-Two, Project Manager of the Negative Gravity Test Project, watched the wrinkled figure of the elderly scientist approach. According to reports, the Aged One still had enough juice left in him to take an interest in his earlier scientific exploits, even though he had served a full stint at the hatching pens. He had been expecting a wrinkled, but still perky Aged One; but what was coming toward him was the sorriest, most dejected cheela he had ever seen since he had been hatched. There must be something wrong.

Then, as Helium-Two watched, the cheela in the distance noticed his presence. Shivering himself all over, Super-Fluid suddenly changed character and moved surely toward him, even though he was partially off in the hard direction.

"I presume you are Helium-Two," the Aged One said with a firm tread. "Thank you for arranging to have me present during the demonstration."

"I knew that you would want to see it," Helium-Two said. "Please follow me."

The two cheela moved in single file across the dense crystal crust of the neutron star. Helium-Two pushed hard, as if he were leaning into a heavy wind. His opalescent, ellipsoidal body flattened out to force an opening between the trillion gauss magnetic field lines. He deferentially held the gap open with a trailing cluster of reinforced manipulator arms that allowed the elder scientist to flow after him with minimum effort. They paused to look around; as they did so, they felt the magnetic field close in on them again, their bodies pinned onto the field lines like beads on a wire.

"How do you like it, Super-Fluid?" Helium-Two asked. "Big, isn't it?"

"I don't see much of anything except those large pumps over there and some ridges in the crust."

"We had to put most of the antigravity machine underground because of the high pressures. Underneath those ridges are the largest high pressure vessels ever made by cheela. They are formed of strong pipes wrapped around and around in the shape of a ring wrapped with wire. You can see one ring under that ridge and the top of the other ring over there. They are set up at an angle to each other so that the place of maximum interaction is just above the surface in the middle."

"I didn't visualize anything like this when I was working on the theory," Super-Fluid said, as his dozen eyes took in the vista.

"You are lucky. Very few theoretical scientists ever see their mathematical equations turned into working hardware in their lifetime, especially when the theoretical work involves such a fundamental change in our understanding of nature such as does the Super-Fluid-Einstein theory of gravitation. Einstein himself was one of the few. He lived to see his _E=mc&sup2;_ prediction bring about control of nuclear energy. Einstein was lucky because it turned out to be easy for the humans to get a nuclear chain reaction going---they just have to bring two pieces of uranium or plutonium near each other. You are fortunate in that it is easy for us to get the very high mass-densities and velocities that are needed to make the Super-Fluid effect work."

"I wish you wouldn't use that term," Super-Fluid said. "The correct term is the gravimotive effect. People keep referring to the effect by my name---and I appreciate the honor, but I am thinking of the poor students in the future. They are going to have a hard time remembering that the Super-Fluid effect is the gravimotive effect and does not have anything to do with superconductivity."

The two started back toward the bunker as Super-Fluid went on, "I have always been proud of the unusual name that the Old Ones chose for me when I was a hatchling. Like you, I was hatched during the generation when the humans were beaming down the _SUPERCONDUCTIVITY_ section of their encyclopedia. The theories of superconductivity revolutionized our understanding of the interior of our home star. It made quite an impression on everyone to learn that we are floating on a crystalline crust over a liquid core of superfluid neutrons."

"All right---the gravimotive effect," Helium-Two said. "Anyway, the gravitational engineers did a good job on the design. The antigravity machine is a lot more efficient and compact than I thought it would be when I took on the job of managing the design and construction contract."

Helium-Two went around the bunker to the entrance in the rear. "Come inside, then we will give the machine its first try. We will only take it to half-power in this first trial. We won't try to make the gravity force go negative, but there should be plenty of interesting effects when we get to zero gravity."

The project manager and the scientist went into the low bunker. They raised some of their eyes up on short conical stubs and looked out over the top. Helium-Two spent the next few moments going over the checklist with the gravitational engineers.

"It is a big moment for them, too," Helium-Two thought. "They have been studying and training for many turns, and this is the first time they will be able to see the theories they studied work."

Everything was soon ready and Helium-Two signaled for the power to be applied. Super-Fluid could feel the vibrations from the great pumps as they started to move their massive loads of ultra-dense liquid. The fluid moved around in the pipes at a constantly increasing velocity. The acceleration supplied by the pumps was so great that the velocity of the dense fluid would begin to approach the speed of light in a millisecond. However, that would be more than time enough for the fast-living cheela to carry out a leisurely experiment.

Super-Fluid could almost visualize the Einstein gravity fields generated by the motion of the liquid and was not surprised to see the crust in the center of the machine lift up and flow out from the center. Soon there was a great cavity almost a centimeter deep, as the Einstein fields took hold and started to nullify the neutron star's 67-billion-gee gravitational field.

"So far it has all been Einstein antigravity fields," Helium-Two whispered to him. "Very shortly the hyper-nonlinear portion of your theory should take over and we should get the contraction of the Einstein fields into a region at the center."

They watched tensely as the crust started to flow back to fill in the depression---more slowly this time---while the whine of the pumps moved to higher and higher pitch. Soon the crust was nearly what it had been before, but now above the crust at the center of the machine was a distortion in the atmosphere.

"Why can we see the region?" Helium-Two asked. "It can't be a distortion in space-time caused by strong gravity fields. The gravity is less there than it is here."

"No," Super-Fluid said, awed in spite of himself. "The explanation is much more pragmatic than that. The low-gravity region is visible because it doesn't have any atmosphere. The atmosphere has all flowed to the outside edges. That is an oval-shaped chunk of outer space hanging in front of you, and what you are seeing is the difference in the index of refraction of vacuum and the atmosphere."

"Now for the fun part," Helium-Two said. "We are going to inject a small chunk of pure carbon into the zero gravity region and see what happens."

Helium-Two turned to the crew and initiated the sequence of events. Super-Fluid watched as a short stubby cylinder started to rise up out of the crust right under the distortion. He could feel powerful hydraulic pumps complaining as the top of the cylinder started to approach the edge of the oval-shaped region.

"That last little bit of distance is going to take some time," Helium-Two said, as the hydraulic pumps labored under the strain. "Moving those few microns from our normal gravity to the zero gravity in the gravimotive-effect region is equivalent to going straight up off our neutron star into outer space. Not much distance to travel, but it takes a lot of energy. We are going to stop the cylinder just as it gets to the inner edge, and fire the carbon pellet from a gun built into the piston."

The vibration of the hydraulic pumps finally stabilized and began to beat with the rising whine of the antigravity generator pumps that kept the distortion activated. Helium-Two turned a few of his eyes toward his engineers and his undertread rumbled an order through the crust: "Inject!"

Super-Fluid watched as a tiny speck rose from the center of the piston and floated to the center of the distortion, brightly illuminated by lights that flooded the central region with X-rays. As he watched, the speck grew, and by the time it had reached the center and hung there, it had grown to be almost as round as he was wide.

"Why doesn't it fall out of the zero gravity region as the atmosphere did?" Super-Fluid asked.

Helium-Two replied, "Those X-ray lights are not just for illumination, they are also coupled to a servo control system. We use X-ray pressure to keep the carbon speck centered in the zero gravity region."

"As it gets bigger, it gets harder to see," Super-Fluid said, watching in awe and amazement as the tiny speck of degenerate crystalline carbon slowly came apart. Once the material had been released from the tremendous gravitational pressures exerted by the neutron star, the nuclear repulsive forces took over and the nuclei moved further and further apart. Now that there was space between the nuclei, the electrons, which had been packed into a superconductive fluid coursing through the close-packed array of carbon nuclei, began to evaporate from the fluid to take up orbits around the nuclei, further isolating the nuclei from each other. Soon the tiny speck had grown a hundred times larger in each direction while its density dropped by a million.

"I can't see it anymore," Super-Fluid said.

"I can, and it's beautiful," Helium-Two said, waving one of his eyes after another. "At least with some of my eyes. I think I can fix things so we can both see it without having to move around." He went to the servo control console and talked to the engineer there.

He returned. "I had the engineer set the servo control so that the crystal would rotate while staying in place."

They both watched as the seemingly empty space suddenly sparkled into a brilliant flash of light---then winked off again.

"You wouldn't think that something with a density of only a few grams per cubic centimeter would be visible at all---much less be so brilliant," Helium-Two said.

"It is because the crystal structure reflects the X-rays when the atomic planes of the crystal are at just the right angle between one of the lights and one of our eyes," Super-Fluid explained. "I have been watching the pattern carefully as it rotates. If I am not mistaken, that is a crystal with a cubic lattice structure. What did you say the seed material was?"

"Carbon," Helium-Two said.

"I think that is what the humans call a diamond," Super-Fluid said. "They were right---it is pretty."
