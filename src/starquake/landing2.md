The call that Pierre had been dreading came. "Request asteroid O-l be reprogrammed to arrive at spacetime point given by following coordinates," said the image of Cliff-Web. There followed an _x,y,z,&theta;,&phi;,&lambda;,&tau;_ listing of coordinates in the Dragon's Egg spacetime system. The requested orbit went far down in the gravity well of Egg so that the ten percent time rate and frame drag difference between deep space and the surface of the neutron star was significant.

Cliff-Web was not used to talking to humans. He forgot to always assume the same position each time he checked in at the screen for a reply, so his image flickered every fifth of a second.

Pierre hesitated. The image flickered.

The real decision had been made long ago. Pierre touched the screen in front of him, and the coordinates were transferred to the herder rockets that kept Otis on its desired path. Pierre then pushed the _execute_ square on his touch screen. The engines on the herder rockets flared. Within seconds Otis was on a new trajectory that would take it within a few meters of the surface of Dragon's Egg.
