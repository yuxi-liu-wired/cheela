The interstellar ark, St. George, settled into its orbit around the spinning neutron star at a radius of 100,000 kilometers and with a period of thirteen minutes. The science crew began their scientific surveys. Although they would get much better data when they could go down in Dragon Slayer to look at the neutron star from only 400 kilometers away, they still could do a preliminary survey with the long-range telescopes.

Jean Kelly Thomas was belted into the seat in front of the imaging science console on St. George. The belt was adjusted to accommodate the fact that she was sitting on her crossed legs. With her cap of short red hair and her upturned nose, she looked like a pixie seated on a toadstool (with seat belt). Her bright blue eyes flicked over the features of the latest scan of the hydrogen-alpha ultraviolet imager. The computer had noticed something unusual in the last scan and had alerted her.

A blinking square drew her attention to a small oval bull's-eye pattern that had appeared on the image of the star. In the upper corner of the screen, the computer had printed:

    LYMAN-ALPHA SCAN TAKEN 14:44:05 22 MAY 2050
    NEW FEATURE AT 54 W LONG, 31 N LAT

Jean leaned forward. "Identification?" The image remained, but the words were replaced with:

    TENTATIVE IDENTIFICATIONâ€”ACTIVE VOLCANO.
    CENTER TEMPERATURE 15,000 DEGREES.

Jean spoke again, "Switch Lyman-alpha scanner to high resolution scan of target region!"

She watched as the image was replaced on the screen with a close-up of the volcano. The image blinked five times a second as the imager took a scan at each rotation of the star. As she watched, she could see a flare-up in the central region, followed by a streak of brightness that flowed away from the center, the lava flow getting dimmer and dimmer as it moved.

A detailed history of the birth and death of a volcano was certainly worth keeping a careful watch on. Perhaps if they were lucky, the amount of matter that built up in the shield would become so great that it would initiate a starquake during their visit. That should set the whole star to vibrating and they might be able to determine the internal resonant modes of the star and get a better computer model for the thickness and density of the inner layers. The new volcano was certainly a high priority item, but it would have to take its turn. She couldn't tie up the scanner to take pictures of only one thing.

She leaned forward again and spoke, "Assign Priority One to this target!

"Inform if any major change or if activity stops!"

She leaned back and pushed the print button.

"A volcano," she thought. "Pierre will surely be interested in this one. He wants to study the internal dynamics of this star, and now he has some insides to look at. However, the hot gas and dust that monster is emitting are sure going to complicate my atmospheric studies."
