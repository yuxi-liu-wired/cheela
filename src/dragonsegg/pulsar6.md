The following week, the console room was crowded. Professor Sawlinski had brought a few radio astronomers with him, and several of the faculty and graduate students, having heard rumors in the halls, had also gathered to get in on the excitement. Donald had brought along a spacecraft antenna design engineer; together they had dredged up the exact configuration of the low frequency radio antennas on the spacecraft and calculated the exact radiation pattern of each arm. The antenna patterns were very complex because the response of an individual arm depended strongly on the detailed shape of the spacecraft on the side where that particular arm was attached.

Jacqueline was also ready with a complex data reduction program that would produce five plots on the screen, one showing the signal detected in each arm, and one showing the combined response of all the arms.

Donald turned from his console, where he had been monitoring the engineering data from the Deep Space Network.

"The dump is finished. You should find the data in the computer files now," he said.

Jacqueline's hands flew over the keyboard and soon five greenish white lines were snaking their way across the screen.

"Here comes the scruff," she said. Then leaning forward she looked at the four top traces and exclaimed, "The pulses are showing up in only one of the antenna arms!"

It soon was obvious that, as the spacecraft tumbled slowly through space with its four long antenna arms sweeping across different portions of the sky, one of the antennas was doing a much better job of picking up the high frequency pulses than were the others. They would now be able to do a better job of pinpointing the source in the sky.

The spacecraft antenna design engineer shook his head in puzzlement. "It doesn't make sense that one of those antennas would be that much more sensitive than the others. After all, they are only long hunks of wire, and their antenna patterns should not look all that different. Which one is it?"

"Antenna number two," Jacqueline said.

The engineer turned to his console and soon a directivity pattern, fleshed out in pseudo-three-dimensional shape by the computer, flashed on the screen.

"I don't see any significant directivity here," he said.

Donald had been watching, and had noticed a frequency number at the bottom of the screen.

"The pulses could be high frequency bursts that are higher than the nominal design frequency for the low frequency radio antennas," he said. "Can you calculate the antenna pattern for a higher frequency?"

"I already have that calculated and stored," said the engineer. He typed in a command and soon the pattern was replaced by another one. Sticking up out of the center of the pattern was a high-gain spike.

The engineer looked at it for a second and then announced, "That spike is called an 'end fire' lobe and is a complex interaction of the antenna with the panel and instruments on that side of the spacecraft. We often see such spikes showing up at the high frequency end of the design range." He turned to Jacqueline and said, "That makes it easy; your pulses are coming from the direction the antenna is pointing."

The radio astronomers began to get interested. They now knew in which direction relative to the spacecraft the pulsating signals came from. However, it took a few hours of work with the Deep Space Network and the spacecraft engineers before they knew exactly how the spacecraft was oriented with respect to the stars when the pulses were at their maximum.

Within two days, several radio dishes were pointing their narrow beams out into space, searching for the new pulsar. Even though they knew the exact period and even to a fraction of a second when they should see a pulse, none was found. The mystery grew deeper.
