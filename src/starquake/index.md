# Starquake
My thanks to my many friends who contributed ideas and helped me in several technical areas. In addition to those who helped in making the neutron star world of _Dragon's Egg_ more believable, I want to thank Paul Blass, Rod Hyde, Keith Lofstrom, David Lynch, Lester del Rey, and Mark Zimmermann for additional help on this sequel.

My special thanks to Eve for generating new names for the many generations of cheela that lived, fought, and died on the following pages and to Martha for putting up with a husband constantly off in a brown study.
