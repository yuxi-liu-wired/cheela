Three turns before the dedication of the Holy Temple, God's-Chosen knew there was a problem. He had seen the pulsating, multicolored beam go south. But then it had stopped. The time came near, and he looked in vain at the Inner Eye. He could see no beams---no light of any kind.

"Bright is testing my faith," he said to himself. "For many greats of turns the people have had to accept my word that the Blessing of Bright was coming. Now I am as blind as they are. I must have faith."

God's-Chosen asked that the Temple be cleared, and when the crowds and astrologers were all outside the orifices, he went in alone and climbed up on the Inner Eye mound to pray.

God's-Chosen looked out from the central mound across the empty inner court toward the outer walls in the distance. There was no doubt in his mind. This was what Bright had wanted. He turned his eyes to the sky, and looking south toward Bright, began to pray.

"O Bright. Give me the faith that the others have, and if my belief falters, help me to overcome my weakness so that I may believe in you and your Blessing."

God's-Chosen slowly moved down the inner mound and went out the western orifice toward the astrologers' compound. As he left, the troopers, who had been keeping the people out, finally let the crowds pour in, for the dedication was only a turn away. For fully half a turn cheela poured through the orifices and gathered around the inner mound. Soon the inner courtyard of the Temple was full, with little groups gathered around outside each of the twelve entrances. Some climbed laboriously up to watch from the top of the walls when they found they could not get inside.

As the time grew near, the High Priest went to fetch God's-Chosen, who had isolated himself in the old temple. As Bright's-First approached the old temple area, he could hear God's-Chosen in a whispered prayer to Bright, and even he was stirred by the genuineness of the supplication.

"Bright. Give me the strength to do as you will have me do."

The prayer stopped, for God's-Chosen had felt the tread of the High Priest through the crust. As Bright's-First came nearer, God's-Chosen appeared at the entrance.

"Let us go and receive the Blessing of Bright," he said, leading the way to the Holy Temple.

Together the High Priest and God's-Chosen moved through the throngs gathered in front of the western orifice. They were followed by a large group of astrologers, all experienced in speaking to crowds. Slowly the procession made its way through the packed inner courtyard and up the slopes of the Inner Eye mound.

At the top, God's-Chosen and the High Priest took up a position at the center of the mound while the other astrologers formed a circle around them. God's-Chosen looked out at the multitude, whose every eye seemed to be upon him. He would have liked to have talked to them all directly, but there was no way that even his far-carrying, high-pitched voice could reach them all. Fortunately, most of the throng had been to one of the previous services where he had called down the Blessing of Bright, so they knew the ritual.

God's-Chosen scanned the Eyes. It had been many turns since he had last seen the beam from the Inner Eye, and he was now unsure exactly when to expect the Blessing to come.

God's-Chosen began the service as they had planned it. He would chant the prayers, which would carry out and down the mound to the nearest ranks of cheela. The chant would then be repeated by the High Priest and the rest of the astrologers, the combined treading of the chorus carrying through the crust even to those at the farthest walls. The prayers would then be echoed by the rumbling treads of the multitude.

"Bright the glorious!

"We believe!

"Bring your Blessing!"

God's-Chosen paused, but nothing happened. He went on.

"Bring your Blessing!

"Down upon us!"

He paused again, waiting in vain for the Blessing to come down upon them all. In desperation he continued.

"We are waiting.

"In your Temple!

"Bring Your Blessing!"

For the first time in many greats of turns, God's-Chosen felt his faith falter. There was a subdued murmur from the crowd. There was nothing hostile, just bewilderment, for God's-Chosen had never failed before.

God's-Chosen gazed upward at the Eyes, longing for the sight of the Blessing. None came.

Without further word, God's-Chosen moved his pale body through the ring of astrologers, down the mound and out into the multitude, heading for the eastern orifice.

Some of the crowd whispered as he passed, others reached out to touch his hot pale body with a slender tendril. The High Priest, still up on the mound, tried to salvage things by proceeding with the regular worship chants, but no one paid him heed---not even the chorus.

As God's-Chosen left the Temple, the multitude of worshipers broke up into bewildered groups. Many had gone without food for a full turn, and they now went out to find something to eat in the overcrowded city.

By the next turn, food had run short and the crowds became nasty. Some recalled the original clan name of God's-Chosen, and from then on, whenever he was mentioned, it was by his old name of Pink-Eyes.

The High Priest went to discuss the previous turn's events with Hungry-Swift, the Leader of the Combined Clans. Hungry-Swift was completely demoralized by the experience.

"I am sorry that you too were taken in by that charlatan," Bright's-First said.

"But I saw! I saw the Blessing coming down!" protested Hungry-Swift.

"Yes---you may have seen the Blessing of Bright, but this Pink-Eyes person was using the Blessing of Bright to his own advantage," the High Priest replied. "He said that he gave the Word of Bright, and that he was God's-Chosen. But was he? No! Bright chose this way to say that he was a false prophet, for Bright withheld his Blessing before all the multitude."

"You seem to be right," Hungry-Swift agreed.

"I am right," the High Priest said. "I have served Bright longer than this pink-eyed hatchling. You must do something about this fraudulent impostor."

Hungry-Swift was too dejected to do anything. Bright's-First took advantage of his hesitancy and gave a command to a squad of troopers nearby.

"Bring Pink-Eyes to the Temple!" he commanded.

The troopers hesitated, looking at Hungry-Swift, who remained silent. Finally the troopers moved off to carry out the High Priest's command. They found Pink-Eyes in the wilderness to the east of Bright's Heaven. He had been going back toward the Eyes, constantly looking upward for the missing beams of light.

The troopers had no problem with Pink-Eyes, and they treated him gently. Most of them had experienced the Blessing of Bright and were still in awe of the personality in the tiny pale body.

"You are to come with us," the squad leader stated. Without a word, Pink-Eyes reversed his direction of travel and went back along the pathway, with the troopers surrounding him.

As they slowly made their way back west, paced by the small tread of Pink-Eyes, the crowds gathered again. As they passed, most of them stared, their treads silent. Other groups, hungry and angry, muttered into the crust, and a few rolled sharp fragments of crust into the pathway in front of Pink-Eyes. He did not swerve but moved steadily onward, often leaving a sharp fragment wet with his warm white juices after his tread had passed over it. The squad leader saw what was happening, and put two troopers on either side to keep the pathway clear.

As they passed through the outskirts of Bright's Heaven and headed for the Temple, the crowds following them grew. As they entered the eastern orifice of the Temple, Pink-Eyes saw that the inner courtyard was partially full.

The troopers led Pink-Eyes up the inner mound where the High Priest and the Leader of the Combined Clans waited. Bright's-First led the interrogation.

"Are you God's-Chosen?" the High Priest asked.

"If you believe it, then I am," was the reply.

"Well, I don't believe it," the High Priest said angrily. "Admit you are a fraud!"

Pink-Eyes made no reply.

Bright's-First turned his eyes to Hungry-Swift and said firmly, "I say we should turn him into meat!"

Hungry-Swift hesitated. "He did bring us the Blessing," he said.

"Maybe," countered the High Priest. "But where is it now? He has caused us to lose it."

As the two leaders talked, Pink-Eyes had been gazing alternately at Bright and the Eyes for guidance. Suddenly he saw a beam from the Inner Eye!

"I can see it again!" he called out.

"What?" the startled Hungry-Swift asked. The High Priest was worried. Could it be that this creature had arranged all this in order to bring down Bright's curse upon him, to destroy him, and take over as High Priest?

"I can see the Blessing of Bright," Pink-Eyes said, but then in despair he saw that the beam was no longer coming toward them, but instead was pointing toward the north.

Hungry-Swift looked up at the Inner Eye, searching in vain for the faint flicker that he had longed to see these many turns. "I don't see anything," he said.

"I am afraid that you cannot," Pink-Eyes said. "The beam is now going off to the north."

"The north!" the High Priest exclaimed in relief. "That is the territory of the barbarians! By your own admission you have caused Bright to avert his Blessing from us and give it to the barbarians."

There were angry murmurs from the crowd at the base of the mound.

"Away with him!" the High Priest shouted, and Hungry-Swift and his troopers stood by helplessly while an angry crowd flowed up the mound and pushed and rolled the helpless pale body down the slope.

Sharp prickers were pulled from weapons pouches; they prodded at Pink-Eyes' edges, forcing him out the eastern orifice of the Temple. A storage bin at a nearby needle trooper compound was raided and two dozen long dragon tooth spears were brought and laid out on the ground. Pink-Eyes was then forced onto the row of spear shafts. The ends of the shafts were raised by burly warriors. As Pink-Eyes felt his tread leave the crust, he went into a hysterical panic. The small pale body was easily carried to a nearby field.

The crust in the field had recently been plowed and seeded, but it would be a long time before the petal plants would grow. Now, however, a more vicious crop was springing up, as warrior after warrior planted a slicer or pricker in the crumbled crust, point upwards.

Pink-Eyes' tread trembled in pain as his body was lowered down over the points. He tried to support his body on the narrow shafts of the spears, while lifting the rest of his tread away from the tormenting pricks. Then the spear shafts were pulled out from underneath his trembling tread. His tortured body fell helplessly onto the crust, the slicers and prickers glinting up through his topside, wet points glowing white with his juices.

In agony, Pink-Eyes attempted to lift his pale body off the agonizing shards of dragon crystal, but with each heave he only sliced his body further. He gave up trying, and slowly spread out as his juices flowed into the crust.

"O Bright," his tortured tread cried in muffled agony, "Bring down your Blessing---even on these---for they want you too much."

It was half a turn before the butchering crew was called. There was not much meat on that tiny carcass, and the meat had the same sickly paleness that the skin had. One of the butcher crew sucked at a hunk of meat. "It does not even taste right," she said. "I wouldn't eat this stuff."

"You are right," another said after taking a small taste. So by common consent, the body was left in the field to dry on the glowing crust, the shrinking skin pricked through with sharp shards of dragon crystal abandoned by their former owners.
